# CHAPTER 10 – The Noisy Void

## Chapter 10 – The Noisy Void

The house felt like a vacuum that swallowed every sound. The refrigerator hummed, the street outside shouted with traffic, and inside the walls seemed to echo the emptiness that had settled after the argument.

Camila tried to focus on the paperwork she needed for the divorce, but every rustle of a paper reminded her of the broken promises that littered the rooms.

She opened a new notebook, titled **"Divorce Checklist"**, and wrote the first item:

1. Find a lawyer.
2. Gather financial documents.
3. Decide custody schedule.
4. Pack a bag.
5. Tell the kids.

The list felt both empowering and terrifying. Each bullet was a step toward freedom, but also a reminder that the life she had built was unraveling.

She stared at the ceiling, listening to the distant sirens, and whispered to herself:

> *"I’m not scared of the void. I’m scared of staying in it forever."

The noise outside became a soundtrack for her resolve. The city’s chaos mirrored the turmoil inside her, but also reminded her that life kept moving, even when she felt stuck.

She picked up her phone, typed **"divorce lawyer São Paulo"**, and hit search. The first result was a law firm that offered a free 30‑minute consultation. She bookmarked it, feeling a small spark of hope.

The night grew louder, the wind rattling the windows, but Camila finally felt a sliver of control. She could hear the world outside, and for the first time in weeks, she could hear herself thinking clearly.
