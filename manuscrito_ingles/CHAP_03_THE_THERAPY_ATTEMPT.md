# CHAPTER 3
## The Therapy Attempt

Three days after Leo's birthday, the bitter taste of disappointment still hadn't left Camila's mouth. It was as if she had bitten into a rotten fruit and the flavor persisted, contaminating everything she ate, drank, or spoke.

Wednesday night.

The house was finally quiet. The children slept. The dishwasher hummed monotonously in the kitchen—one of the few appliances in that house that actually helped Camila when she pressed a button.

She was in the bathroom, staring at her reflection in the mirror illuminated by the white, merciless light.

She had rehearsed that conversation in the shower. Had rehearsed it in traffic. Had rehearsed it while folding Ricardo's underwear.

*"We need to talk."* (Too cliché).
*"I'm not happy."* (Too aggressive, he would get defensive).
*"I think we need help."* (Better. Sounded collaborative).

Camila breathed deep. Exhaled slowly. Applied cream to her hands just to have something to do with them in case she started shaking.

She headed to the living room.

Ricardo was there, in his natural habitat: the left corner of the retractable sofa, legs stretched out, remote control in his right hand, cell phone in his left. The TV displayed some news program on mute.

"Love?" she called.

"Speak," he answered, eyes fixed on the cell phone screen. He was watching a video of funny dogs. Camila heard the high-pitched barks coming from the device.

She sat on the other end of the sofa. Kept a safe distance.

"Can you put the phone down for a minute? Please."

Her tone of voice must have been different, because Ricardo stopped. Locked the screen (but kept his finger on the trigger) and looked at her.

"What is it? Did something happen to the kids?"

Always the kids. As if that were the only possible catastrophe. The marriage crumbling didn't count as an emergency.

"No. It's about us."

He sighed. It wasn't a loud, theatrical sigh. It was subtle. A short exhalation through the nose and a slight eye roll imperceptible to laymen, but screaming to a wife of eight years. *Here she comes.*

"Okay. Go ahead."

"Ricardo, I've been thinking a lot these days. Since Leo's party. And before too."

"Oh, no. Going back to the party subject? I already apologized, Camila. I arrived, didn't I? Brought a gift and everything."

"It's not just about the party. The party was just... the symptom." She used the word she had read on a psychology blog earlier today.

"Symptom?" He laughed, nervous. "Now you've turned into a doctor?"

"Ricardo, listen." She leaned forward. "We aren't good. We don't talk anymore. We just... coexist. I manage the house and the kids, you work and pay the bills, and we meet in the hallway. I feel lonely. And I think you must also miss how we were before."

He stared at her with an undecipherable expression. Boredom? Fear? Hunger?

"I think..." she continued, her courage wavering. "That we should try couples therapy."

The silence that followed was heavy, dense. The hum of the dishwasher seemed deafening.

Ricardo blinked. Then let out a short, dry laugh.

"Therapy? Are you serious?"

"I am. Very serious. I researched some professionals here in the neighborhood. There's a great psychologist who focuses on couples with small children, on rescuing partnership..."

"Partnership..." He repeated the word as if it were an exotic foreign term. "Camila, look at me. Do I look like someone who's going to sit in a beige armchair to talk about my childhood to a stranger?"

"It's not about childhood, Ricardo. It's about us. About communication. About sharing the load."

He straightened up on the sofa, his defensive posture armed.

"What load, Camila? For God's sake. We have a good life. Own apartment, two cars, healthy kids in private school. You're complaining with a full belly. There are women out there whose husbands drink, beat them, burn money gambling. I'm a family guy."

The "Minimal Bar" appeared again.

"I know you're a family guy. But I don't just want a husband who doesn't hit me. I want a partner. Someone who is *with me*. Ricardo, I'm exhausted. I feel like I carry the world on my back and you're watching from the bleachers."

"Ah, there it is. The 'warrior woman' drama. Camila, I work ten hours a day! Do you think I sit around scratching myself at the office? I carry the financial weight of this family."

"And I carry all the rest!" Her voice rose. "The emotional, the domestic, the logistical! Who schedules doctors? Who knows the kids' shoe size? Who remembers to buy a gift for your mother? Who organizes vacations? Who?"

Ricardo raised his hands, as someone surrendering to insanity.

"Okay, okay. You do everything. You're the martyr. Got it. And you think paying three hundred reais an hour for a woman to listen to this is going to change what?"

"It's going to change that maybe you'll listen to me there! Because here you don't listen!"

"I don't need therapy, Camila. If you are unhappy, if you are stressed, you go. Do your therapy, do yoga, take a pill. Solve *your* problem. Don't try to invent problems where there aren't any."

*Solve your problem.*

Camila felt as if she had been physically slapped.

She looked at the man with whom she had shared a bed for almost a decade. Saw the absolute refusal in his eyes. He didn't see "us." He saw "her." The problem was hers. The dissatisfaction was hers. The work was hers.

"So that's it?" she asked, voice thin. "You won't go?"

"No. I won't spend money and time on this nonsense. Our marriage is great for me. If it's bad for you, you're the one who needs to fix yourself."

He unlocked his cell phone. The dog video started playing again.

The conversation was over.
Simple as that.
He decreed the end of the rescue attempt.

Camila stood up. Her legs were trembling. She wanted to scream, break the TV, rip that cell phone from his hand.

But the exhaustion was greater than the fury.

She went to the bedroom. Lay on the made bed. Looked at the plaster ceiling, at the infiltration stain Ricardo had promised to fix six months ago and never fixed.

*Our marriage is great for me.*

Of course it was. He had a cook, housekeeper, nanny, executive secretary, and personal event planner. All for free. And he still got sex when she wasn't dead tired. Why would he change anything in this perfect arrangement?

Camila cried. A silent, hot cry that burned her temples.

And that night, a cold certainty began to form in her chest, colder than the air conditioner:
*I am alone.*
*And nothing I do will change who he is.*

---

The next day, the routine was a refuge and a torture.

Camila functioned on autopilot. Smiled at the kids, drove, worked.

But her eyes were swollen.

In the office break room, while waiting for coffee from the machine—that horrible generic capsule coffee—Fernanda entered.

Fernanda was the senior copywriter. A thirty-eight-year-old woman, divorced, with an asymmetrical haircut and a frightening ability to read people.

"Good morning... yikes." Fernanda stopped at the door, analyzing Camila. "Did a truck run over you?"

Camila tried to smile, but her lip trembled.

"A truck named Ricardo."

Fernanda closed the break room door. Walked to the machine, poured a coffee, and leaned against the counter, next to Camila.

"Do you want to talk or do you want a hug?"

"I think if you hug me I'll fall apart and get mascara on your shirt."

"Mascara comes out with water. Heartache is the bitch to remove. Talk."

And Camila talked. Vomited everything. The party. The "you're good at this." The conversation the night before. The refusal of therapy. The "solve your problem."

Fernanda listened in silence, drinking her coffee, her intelligent eyes fixed on Camila.

When the venting ended, Fernanda sighed.

"Ca, I'm going to tell you something harsh. Can I?"

"You can. Nothing can be worse than hearing that the problem is me."

"The problem isn't you. The problem is that Ricardo is comfortable."

"Comfortable?"

"It's the 'Naked King Comfort.' He is naked, exposed, being a mediocre husband, but since you are dressing him with all your effort, covering his flaws, making everything work... he feels dressed in velvet. He doesn't feel cold, Camila. The one feeling cold is you."

Fernanda put the cup in the sink.

"Comfortable men don't change. Why would he change? Dinner appears on the table. The kids appear clean. The social agenda happens. The house shines. The cost for him to be like this is zero. The cost is all yours."

Camila looked at the bottom of her empty cup.

"So what do I do? Stop doing things? The house falls. The kids suffer."

"I don't know what you do." Fernanda touched her shoulder. "But I know couples therapy only works when both want to save the relationship. If one thinks everything is fine and the other is bleeding... that's not a marriage. It's parasitism."

*Parasitism.*

The word echoed in Camila's head the rest of the day.

She returned home at night. Saw Ricardo on the sofa. Saw the stain on the ceiling. Saw the dishes in the sink.

He smiled at her when she entered.

"Hey, love? Did the neurosis from yesterday pass?"

Camila looked at him. At the healthy host sucking the life out of her.

"It passed," she lied.

But it hadn't passed. It had changed. The sadness had coagulated and turned into something harder. Something that was beginning to look, dangerously, like indifference.

"Good. Ordered pizza, okay? Too lazy today."

He ordered pizza. Felt like the hero of the night.

Camila went to the room to take off her shoes. Looked at the mirror.

"You choose you," Fernanda whispered in her memory.

*Not yet*, thought Camila. *I don't have the courage yet.*

But the seed was there. Watered with tears and bad coffee, but it was there. Waiting to break the concrete.
