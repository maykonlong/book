# CHAPTER 9
## The Conversation with the Kids

 The hardest part wasn't facing Ricardo.

It wasn't listening to Mrs. Vera.

It wasn't deciding.

The hardest part was looking at Leo and Bia and having to explain that their lives were going to change. That their family was going to change. By her choice.

Guilt was a monster that bit Camila's chest every time she thought about it.

But she knew: it was now or in five, ten, twenty years. And the longer she waited, the worse it would be. For everyone.

Including the children.

---

Ricardo left the house that night.

After the confrontation with Mrs. Vera, after Camila locked herself in the bedroom, he knocked on the door and shouted a few more things (you'll regret it, you're being selfish, you're destroying this family). Camila didn't answer. Eventually, he got tired. Took the keys. Left slamming the door.

Went to his mother's house, presumably.

All the better.

Camila waited to hear the car drive away. Then she left the bedroom.

Leo and Bia were in the living room. Watching cartoons. But not really watching. Just looking at the TV with that empty expression of someone trying not to feel what they are feeling.

Camila sat on the sofa between them.

"Did you guys have dinner?"

Leo shook his head.

"I'm not hungry."

"Me neither," Bia said, quietly.

Camila took the remote and turned off the TV.

"We need to talk."

Bia started whimpering immediately.

"Are you going away?"

Camila's heart broke.

"No, my love. I'm not going away. I will never leave you. Neither you, nor Leo. Never."

"But you fought with daddy."

"I did. And mommy is very, very sad that you saw that. It wasn't supposed to be like that."

Leo, older, more perceptive, asked the question Camila knew would come:

"Are you guys going to separate?"

There was no way to lie. Not to them.

"Yes."

Bia sobbed. Leo went pale.

Camila pulled both of them close. Hugged them. Tight.

"Look at me. Both of you. Look."

They looked. Little eyes full of tears, confusion, fear.

"Daddy and mommy aren't going to live together anymore. And I know that's scary. I'm scared too. But I need you to understand something very important: this is not your fault. Nothing you did caused this. Okay?"

"But why?" Leo asked, voice trembling. "Why can't you stay together?"

How to explain to an eight-year-old child complex concepts like partnership, mental load, emotional toxicity?

Camila tried to simplify:

"Sometimes, two people get married and are happy. And sometimes, over time, they realize they aren't happy together anymore. And when that happens, it's better for them to stay apart, so everyone can be happier."

"But I don't want you to stay apart," Bia cried.

"I know, my love. I know. And if I could do this in a way that didn't hurt you, I would. But sometimes we have to do things that are hard now so that everyone will be better later."

"Will I have to choose?" Leo asked. "Between you and dad?"

"No. Never. You will have both. Always. Just in different houses."

"How does it work?"

Camila breathed. Tried to explain what she herself didn't fully understand yet.

"We are still deciding the details. But you'll probably stay some days with me, other days with dad. And even on the days you aren't with me, you can call me whenever you want. And I will always, always be here for you."

"And on vacations?" Bia asked, still crying. "And on Christmas?"

"We'll make it work. Families can be many different ways. And we will always be a family. Just a different type of family."

Leo stayed quiet. Processing. Then asked:

"Are you sad?"

The question broke Camila.

Why should she lie? Say she was fine, that everything was under control? Or be honest?

She chose honesty.

"I am. Very sad. But also a little relieved. Because I was very tired, Leo. Very, very tired. And I wasn't managing to be happy. And children deserve to have happy moms and dads, even if not together."

Leo hugged his mother. Tight. That hug of a child who understands more than they should.

"I just want you not to be so sad, mom. You've been sad for a long time."

He had noticed.

Of course he had noticed.

Children always notice.

Camila cried. Hugged her two children. And they stayed there, a little ball of sadness and attempted healing, on the living room sofa.

After a while, Bia asked:

"Can we eat pizza?"

Camila laughed through the tears.

"We can. Let's order pizza."

"With stuffed crust?"

"With stuffed crust."

Small things. Small comforts.

They didn't fix everything. But they helped.

---

Ricardo came home late.

Camila heard the key. Heard him entering. Walked to the living room.

He stopped when he saw her.

"The kids?"

"Sleeping."

"You told them."

"I did. They deserved to hear it straight from us."

Ricardo wiped his hand over his face. Seemed, for the first time, genuinely affected.

"Were they upset?"

"What did you expect? That they would celebrate?"

He sat on the sofa. Seemed smaller. More broken.

For a second—just a second—Camila almost felt pity. Almost turned back.

But then she remembered.

Remembered all the times she asked for help and didn't receive it. All the nights she cried alone. All the ignored attempts. Leo, eight years old, having to wake his father because his mother was sick.

Remembered it wasn't just a fight. It was years of disconnection.

And the pity passed.

"We need to decide how it's going to be," she said.

"I don't want this, Camila."

"I know. But I want it. And that has to be enough."

He looked at her. Tried one more time:

"I can change. I'll go to therapy. I'll help more. I promise."

*I promise.*

How many times had she heard that?

How many?

"Ricardo, you had eleven years to change. I asked. I begged. And you only promised when I said I was leaving. That's not wanting to change. That's wanting to hold me back."

"That's not it! I love you!"

"I believe you love me. In your way. But not in the way I need."

"Then what do you need? Tell me! I'll do it!"

But it was late. Too late.

Camila shook her head.

"It's not about making a list and checkboxes. It's about you not needing a list. It's about you wanting to. And you only want to now because I'm leaving. Not because you understood. But because you are losing comfort."

Ricardo fell silent.

Because she was right. And he knew it.

"Tomorrow," Camila said, tired, "I'm going to look for a lawyer. Understand how it works. And we're going to do this as calmly as possible. For our children. But it's going to happen."

"I won't make it easy."

Camila looked at him. Sadness mixed with disappointment.

"I know."

She went to the bedroom. Lay down.

And finally, after everything, felt something she hadn't felt in a long time:

Peace.

It wasn't happiness. Not yet.

But it was peace.

The peace of someone who finally stopped swimming against the current.

Of someone who finally allowed herself to let go.

And sink.

Or float.

Whatever came, would come.

But she wasn't going to fight alone anymore for something that needed two.

Not anymore.

---

The next morning, Camila woke up early.

Made coffee. Woke the kids up. Lunchbox. Did everything as usual.

But something was different.

The weight in her chest was lighter.

The mental list was still there. But it seemed... smaller. More manageable.

Because now there was an end in sight.

An end she chose.

Ricardo left early. Avoiding. Running away. As usual.

And Camila took the kids to school.

Leo got out of the car slowly.

"Mom?"

"Yes, love?"

"Will you be okay?"

The question was a knife to the heart. Because eight years old. He was eight years old and worried about her.

But Camila smiled. Genuine, for the first time in a long time.

"Yes, I will. I promise. And you will too. Everyone will."

He accepted. Because he wanted to believe. And because he needed to believe.

Camila watched them entering the school. Waved. Waited until they disappeared from view.

And then she picked up her cell phone.

Searched: *"divorce lawyer são paulo"*

Opened the first page.

Called.

"Hello, good morning. I would like to schedule a consultation."

And so it began.

The end of the marriage.

And the beginning of something else.

The beginning of Camila.
