# CHAPTER 15
## Painting Again

Dr. Lucas's task echoed in her head like a dangerous mantra: *do something just for you.*

Camila had bought the supplies on Thursday afternoon, leaving work early. Entering the specialty stationery store was like entering a church. The smell of paper, graphite, and wood transported her instantly to age 20.

She spent three hundred reais.
Three hundred reais on paints, brushes, and a block of 300g cotton paper.
At the checkout, the card trembled in her hand.

*This is grocery money. This is half of Leo's swimming tuition.*

Guilt honked loudly.
But she swiped the card anyway.
*It's medicine*, she told herself. *Dr. Lucas said it's mental health. Medicine is expensive indeed.*

Arrived home. The kids were at their father's. The night was hers.

Camila set the dining room table. removed the tablecloth. Put down old newspapers.
Arranged the paints. Filled a glass jar (a reused jam jar) with clean water.

Sat down.

The white paper in front of her was frightening.
Too white. Too perfect. Too expensive to ruin.

"Just start," she whispered to herself.

Picked up the number 6 round brush. Wetted it. Picked up a little cobalt blue.

Her hand trembled.
She touched the brush to the paper.

The paint spread in the water of the damp paper. A bluish explosion, like a cloud forming.

Camila held her breath.
It was beautiful.

She didn't know what to paint. Flowers? Landscape? The empty apartment?

Let her hand go.
Made blotches. Mixed blue with crimson. Saw purple be born.
Dripped clean water and saw alveoli form in the paint.

She wasn't painting "something". She was painting "feeling".

Painted the anger of the faucet (dark red, strong strokes).
Painted the longing for the children (pale yellow, soft).
Painted the loneliness (a bluish gray, cold, but pretty).

And while she painted, she realized she was crying.
Not tears of sadness. Tears of relief.
As if she had pulled a cork from a pressure bottle.

She had spent months just *reacting*. Reacting to the husband, to the children, to work, to the divorce, to problems.
There, with the brush in hand, she was *acting*. Creating. Bringing something new to the world that didn't exist five minutes ago.

Stayed there for three hours.
Forgot to eat dinner. Forgot to check her cell phone.

When she stopped, her back hurt, the water in the jar was mud-colored, and there were five painted sheets scattered on the table drying.

They weren't masterpieces. They were colorful blurs.
But they were hers.
They were pieces of her soul that she had managed to put out without needing to explain with words.

Camila looked at her paint-stained hands. Blue on the cuticles. Red on the palm.

She smiled.
A tired smile, but real.

Photographed the mess and sent it to Fernanda.
Caption: *"I'm back."*

Fernanda replied in seconds:
*"Omg so proud! It's beautiful! (What is it? A nebula or a traffic fight? Joking, it's beautiful!)"*

Camila laughed aloud in the empty room.

Cleaned the brushes with care. Washed the jar. Put the paints away in the new box as if they were jewels.

Went to sleep smelling of gouache paint (okay, watercolor doesn't smell, but olfactory memory invented one).

That night, she didn't dream of bills.
Dreamed she was swimming in a sea of cobalt blue, and that she knew how to breathe underwater.
