# CHAPTER 24
## The End and the Beginning

The divorce came through on a gray Tuesday.
There was no dramatic court scene like in the movies. No fight over silverware.
There was only a notary's office with air conditioning too cold and smell of old coffee.

Ricardo was there. wearing the usual blue suit.
He didn't look in her eyes. Spoke to his lawyer, signed the papers quickly, as if he were signing a traffic ticket he wanted to forget.

Camila signed too.
Her hand didn't tremble.
Her signature came out firm: *Camila Ferreira Santos*. (Had removed his surname. A bureaucratic act, but one that weighed tons less on the soul).

"Done," said the notary. "You are divorced."

Ricardo stood up.
"Good. That's it."
"That's it," said Camila.

He stopped at the door. Hesitated.
"Camila... good luck."
"To you too, Ricardo."

And he left.
Eleven years of marriage. Two children. A whole life built and dismantled.
Ended in twenty minutes and a BIC pen.

Camila left the notary's office.
The sky outside was still gray. The city continued noisy. The world hadn't stopped because her marriage had officially ended.
And that was liberating.

She walked to a coffee shop on the corner.
Entered. Ordered a cappuccino and an orange cake.
Sat at a table near the window.

Opened her purse. Took out the folded divorce paper.
Looked at it.

Waited to feel pain. Waited to cry. Waited to feel the hole in her chest that accompanied her for months.

But felt none of that.
Felt... silence.

A good silence.
The silence of a finished work. The silence after the storm, when the rain stops and only the smell of wet earth remains.

She took a sip of coffee. It was hot, sweet, perfect.
Looked at the street. People passing. Cars. Life happening.

She was alone.
Divorced.
With two children to raise, a career to leverage, bills to pay.

And, for the first time in her entire adult life, she wasn't afraid.
She was at peace.

She picked up her cell phone. Opened the camera.
Didn't take a selfie. Took a photo of the coffee cup and the folded paper on the table.
Posted on stories, just for her (close friends):

*"The End. And the beginning."*

Fernanda replied in seconds: *"PROUD OF YOU! 🥂"*
Daniel (who she had added recently) replied: *"Congratulations on the courage. The coffee looks great."*

Camila smiled.
Ate the orange cake.
Felt the citrus taste on her tongue.

Life had taste again.
And she was hungry.

Saturday. Three in the afternoon.

Camila arrived at Grão Coffee Shop ten minutes late.

Not because of traffic. But because she had circled the block three times before parking. Almost gave up twice. Needed Fernanda sending last-minute motivational message:

*"GO IN THERE. STOP BEING A COWARD. HE IS ONLY HUMAN."*

Took a deep breath. Entered.

Daniel was already there.

Table near the window. Two coffees already ordered (he had asked her preference days before).

When he saw her, he stood up. Smiled. That gentle smile.

Didn't seem annoyed by the delay.

*Mental note: Ricardo would have complained.*

"Hi! Sorry for the delay."

"No problem. I ordered coffee like you said. Hope it's ok."

Camila sat. Picked up the cup. Smelled.

Strong coffee. No sugar. Exactly how she liked it.

"Perfect."

They started with light conversation. Safe. Distant.

Work. Weather. City.

Daniel told about the university where he taught. Funny students. Ridiculous bureaucratic departments.

Camila laughed. For real. Not forced.

He had good comic timing. Self-deprecating without being pathetic.

But part of her was waiting. Waiting for the red flag. For the moment where he would show true colors.

Then it happened.

The waiter ran past. Bumped into the table. Coffee spilled. Brown puddle spreading.

Camila froze.

*This is a test. How does he react when things go wrong casually?*

Ricardo would have exploded. Called the manager. Made a scene. Ruined the rest of the date with bad mood.

Daniel?

Laughed.

"Oh no!" Grabbed napkins. Started cleaning. "It's okay, man. It happens."

The waiter, very young, mortified:

"So sorry! I'll bring another!"

"No stress. Seriously."

Helped clean. Reassured the waiter. Ordered new coffees. Didn't get irritated. Didn't complain. Didn't sour.

Just... dealt with the problem like a functional adult.

And Camila realized: he was different.

Genuinely different.

---

They talked more.

She told about painting. He was truly interested. Asked intelligent questions.

He told about literature. She loved hearing his enthusiasm about books.

Discovered similar taste in movies (both loved slow European dramas).

Shared laughter about bad series they had watched.

And the conversation flowed.

Natural. Easy. Good.

Until Daniel asked, careful:

"Can I ask about your kids?"

Camila got tense. Instinct.

*Is he evaluating if I 'fit'? If I'm too complicated with kids?*

But his tone was genuinely curious. Not judgmental.

"You can."

"How old?"

"Nine and five. Leo and Bia."

"Must be incredible. You talk about them with much affection."

"They are. They are everything." Pause. "I... am a full-time mom besides working full-time too. It's... a lot."

Expected him to back off. To say something like "Wow, must be complicated" with a tone of "you HAVE a lot of baggage".

But instead:

"I imagine. Being a single mom is heroic. Seriously."

Single mom. Heroic.

Not "complicated". Not "baggage".

Green flag.

Continued talking.

Eventually, inevitably, the topic of the ex came up.

"You are recently divorced, right?"

"Six months official. One year separated."

"Must have been difficult."

"It was. And still is sometimes. But it was necessary."

Daniel nodded. Didn't insist. Didn't ask invasive questions.

Just said:

"Everyone deserves to be happy. And sometimes that means difficult choices."

And the tone was so... understanding. Free of judgment.

Camila felt her guard lowering. A little bit.

---

Two hours flew.

The waiter came with a subtle hint that they needed the table (waiting line forming).

"Wow, already?" Camila checked her phone. Five thirty.

"Time went fast." Daniel smiled. "Good sign."

Split the check (he offered to pay, she insisted on splitting, he respected without arguing).

Left together.

Sidewalk. Sun setting. Perfect temperature.

Awkward moment of: what now?

Daniel broke the silence:

"I... really liked it. The conversation, I mean."

"Me too."

"Would you... like to do it again? Someday?"

And there it was. The question.

Part of Camila wanted to run. Create excuse. Keep safe distance.

But the new part—the growing part—wanted to try.

"I would like to. But..." Honesty. Vulnerability. "I need to go slow. Came out of something very difficult. And I'm still... discovering things."

"Totally understandable. No pressure. At the pace you need."

He said without hesitation. Genuine.

"Thank you for understanding."

"Of course." Warm smile. "So... send me a message when you want the next time. No rush."

Hugged for goodbye. Brief but nice.

And Camila walked to the car thinking:

*Huh. This was... really good.*

Not terrifying. Not a disaster.

Just... good.

Maybe, just maybe, not everyone was like Ricardo.

Maybe some people were really what they seemed.

And that thought—simple but revolutionary—changed everything.

---

At home. Alone. Kids with Ricardo.

Camila sat on the sofa. Processed.

Picked up her phone. Texted Fernanda:

*"It was good. Really good. I'm confused."*

Immediate reply:

*"Confused how?"*

*"He was... gentle. Patient. Real. And part of me keeps waiting for the other shoe to drop."*

*"That is trauma response, Ca. You will take time to trust. Normal. But at least you tried."*

*"I liked him."*

*"AND THAT IS GOOD! Stop being afraid of good things!"*

Camila smiled.

Opened the diary. Wrote:

*"First coffee with Daniel.*

*Expected disaster. Had... something good.*

*He was respectful, funny, gentle.*

*Made me laugh for real.*

*When the coffee spilled, didn't get irritated. Laughed.*

*Small thing but shows character.*

*I am afraid. Because it was good. And good is scary after so much bad.*

*But Dr. Lucas is right: not everyone is the ex.*

*Daniel might be different.*

*Or might not be.*

*But at least I am trying.*

*And that is something."*

Closed the diary feeling something unknown:

Hope.

Terrifying, vulnerable hope.

But hope nonetheless.

And that was a start.
