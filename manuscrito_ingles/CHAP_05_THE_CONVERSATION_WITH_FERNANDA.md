# CHAPTER 5
## The Conversation with Fernanda

Monday. The international day of regret for not having lived the weekend one dreamed of.

Camila arrived at the office dragging her feet. Her eyes stung. She had spent Sunday crying hidden in the bathroom while Ricardo watched every game of the Brazilian Championship, one after another, as if it were a paid job.

At 10 AM, she went to the break room. Needed coffee. Caffeine was the only fuel keeping her standing.

The break room was small, smelling permanently of burnt coffee powder and lemon disinfectant. There was a wobbly round table and two plastic chairs.

Fernanda was already there.

Fernanda was a senior copywriter. Thirty-eight years old, divorced, mother of twins, and owner of an energy Camila secretly envied. Fernanda seemed *whole*. Even tired, she seemed self-possessed.

"Good morning... yikes." Fernanda stopped her cup halfway upon seeing Camila's face. "Take down the license plate."

"What license plate?" Camila asked, confused, pouring herself black coffee.

"Of the truck that ran over you. Girlfriend, you have circles under your eyes you could hang a bag on."

Camila tried to laugh, but a strangled sound came out. She leaned against the counter and felt the urge to cry rise up her throat like reflux.

"Yeah... the weekend was hard."

Fernanda put the cup on the table. Her expression changed from playful to attentive.

"Ricardo again?"

Camila nodded. Didn't need to explain. Fernanda knew. Everyone knew, in one way or another, that Camila carried the world on her back.

"Sit here." Fernanda pulled one of the chairs. "The 11 AM agenda can wait."

Camila sat. Looked at the center of the table. There was a sad little pot with a withered succulent, forgotten there by someone from HR. The soil was dry, parched. The leaves were brown and brittle.

"I can't take it anymore, Fe," whispered Camila. "I do everything. I try everything. Romantic dinner, conversation, therapy... and nothing works. He doesn't see me. He acts as if I were an appliance that runs on its own."

Fernanda listened. She had that rare gift of listening without interrupting with "it's like that with me too." She just listened.

"I feel... hollow," continued Camila. "I feel like I'm screaming in a soundproof room. And the worst part is I still love him. Or think I love him. Or love the idea of what we could be."

Camila picked up a sugar packet and started tearing the edges, nervous.

"I keep thinking: if I try a little more... if I am more patient... if I explain it another way... maybe he'll wake up."

Fernanda sighed. She looked at the little plant pot on the table.

"Ca, look at this plant."

Camila looked.

"It's dead, right?" said Fernanda.

"Yeah. Dried up."

"Imagine you decide to save this plant. You bring imported fertilizer. You water it with volcanic mineral water. You play classical music for it. You talk to it every day. You spend the whole day taking care of it."

Fernanda paused.

"Will it revive?"

Camila looked at the brown leaves, crackling dry. The root had probably turned to dust.

"No. It already died."

"Exactly." Fernanda looked into Camila's eyes. "You can be the best gardener in the world. You can give your blood as fertilizer. But you can't resurrect what has already died. And, friend... sorry to tell you this with such frankness, but I see you killing yourself to water a relationship that dried up a long time ago."

The metaphor hit Camila like a physical slap.

*Watering a dead plant.*

That was it. That was exactly it. All her effort. All the tiredness. All the elaboration of dinners, conversations, plans. It was all water spilled on dead earth.

"But how do I know?" asked Camila, voice trembling. "How can I be sure it died? What if it's just... sleeping?"

"You know," said Fernanda, softly. "You know because you are alone in it. A living relationship has exchange. It has two gardeners. If only you are holding the watering can while the other complains there's too little shade... that's not a marriage. It's parasitism."

*Parasitism.*

Camila closed her eyes. The image of Ricardo on the sofa, cell phone in hand, while she ran the house, came to mind. He wasn't a partner. He was a VIP guest.

"I'm scared," confessed Camila. "Scared of separating. Of the kids. Of money. Of being alone."

"The fear is real." Fernanda held her hand over the cold table. "I was scared shitless when I separated. But do you know what's scarier?"

"What?"

"Spending the next thirty years feeling exactly how you are feeling now. Alone, exhausted, and invisible."

Fernanda squeezed her hand.

"The loneliness of being single we solve with friends, with books, with wine, with our own company. But the loneliness of being married to someone who doesn't see you... that loneliness is a cancer, Camila. It eats you from the inside."

Camila looked at the dead succulent.

There, in the break room, smelling of old coffee, something changed. The stubborn hope—the one that made her try dinners and therapies—began to give way to something else.

A cold acceptance.
A lucid understanding.

She wasn't fighting for a marriage. She was fighting against reality.

"Thank you, Fe," said Camila.

"No need to thank. Just... stop wasting your water where nothing sprouts anymore. Keep it for yourself. You need it."

Fernanda stood up, kissed Camila's forehead, and left.

Camila stayed there another minute.
She picked up the little pot with the dead plant.
Stood up.
And threw it in the trash.

The sound of the pot hitting the bottom of the bin was the only noise in the room.
*Thud.*

End. It was over.
She wasn't going to water corpses anymore.
