# CHAPTER 25
## One Year Later: The New Peace

One year.
It had been twelve months since Ricardo had left.

The routine was different now. It wasn't perfect, but it was *hers*.

Sunday night. The intercom rang. Ricardo returning the children.

In the past, this moment caused tachycardia in Camila. She would get anxious to know if they ate, if they did homework, if Ricardo had spoken ill of her.

Today?
Camila was on the sofa, finishing a book, with a glass of wine in her hand.

The door opened. The kids entered like a hurricane.
"Mom! Dad let me play GTA all afternoon!" shouted Leo.
"Mom! We ate McDonald's for lunch and dinner!" told Bia.

Camila looked at Ricardo, standing at the door. He looked tired. His clothes slightly wrinkled (no one ironed for him, remember?).
"Bye, kids. Bye, Camila."
"Bye, Ricardo. Thank you."

He left. The door closed.

Camila looked at her children. Dirty with ketchup. Wired on sugar and screens.

The Camila of a year ago would have freaked out. Would have yelled at Ricardo. Would have spent hours anguished about how they were being "spoiled".

The Camila of today?
She smiled.

"Okay, little monsters. Dad's weekend was the weekend of mess. Now begins mom's week. The week of order."

"Ahhh no..." complained Leo, but without conviction.
"Ah yes. Bath now. And tomorrow there's beans and salad."

She took them to a bath. While she scrubbed Bia's back, she thought:
Ricardo could be the dad of easy fun. The dad of sugar and video games.
But she was the safe harbor.
She was the one who cured the flu, who helped with math, who taught them to eat broccoli and have empathy.

And the children, in their infinite wisdom, knew.
Knew they could have fun there, but that it was *here* that life really happened.

Leo came out of the bath smelling of lavender soap. Lay on her lap on the sofa.
"Mom?"
"Hi."
"Dad is cool. But I like coming back home."
"Yeah? Why?"
"Because here is... calm. And smells like you."

Camila kissed his forehead.
"It's good to have you back, son."

She didn't need to compete with the father.
She didn't need to prove anything.
She just needed to be a mother.

And that night, with the house silent again, the children sleeping clean and safe, Camila felt immense gratitude.
For the divorce.
Because it had allowed her to build this sanctuary.
A home where there were no stifled screams, nor tension in the air.
Just peace. And love. And lavender smell.

One month.

One month since the first coffee with Daniel.

And in this month, they had met five times. Always casual. Always at his invitation, because Camila still didn't have the courage to take initiative.

Coffee. Quick lunch. Walk in the park. Movies. Another coffee.

And on each date, Camila tested.

Not consciously. But instinctively.

Projecting Ricardo where there was no Ricardo.

---

Date three. Lunch.

Daniel offered to pay.

Camila immediately thought: *"Does he want financial control? Create emotional debt?"*

Refused firmly:

"No, let's split."

"Are you sure? I don't mind..."

"I am. I prefer it this way."

He accepted without arguing. Split the check.

Later, driving home, Camila processed: he had accepted the boundary without getting offended. Ricardo would have thrown a tantrum.

Green flag. But she still doubted.

---

Date four. Movies.

Daniel asked about the children.

Camila froze instantly.

*"Is he evaluating if I fit? If I'm too complicated?"*

Answered defensive:

"Why do you ask?"

Daniel blinked surprised:

"Because... you are a mother? And I imagine it's an important part of your life. Just genuine curiosity."

His tone was gentle. Not interrogative.

Camila relaxed slightly:

"Sorry. It's just that..." Stopped. Decided for honesty. "It's just that I'm used to people judging me for being a divorced mother."

"I would never judge that. Life situations are complex. And you seem like an amazing mother by the way you talk about them."

No judgment. Compliment.

Camila didn't know how to process so much kindness.

---

Date five. Walk in the park.

Daniel canceled last minute.

Message: *"Ca, so sorry. Heavy flu. Don't want to pass it to you. Can we reschedule?"*

And Camila's anxiety skyrocketed.

*"It started. The disinterest. Making up excuses. Typical."*

Answered coldly:

"It's okay. Get better."

Daniel seemed to notice the tone:

*"I REALLY wanted to go. But I have a fever of 38. Promise to reschedule as soon as I get better. Ok?"*

Photo of him in bed. Clearly sick. Thermometer showing.

It wasn't an excuse.

It was genuine.

Camila felt immediate guilt:

*"Sorry! Of course. Get better soon. Need anything?"*

*"Just time. Thank you for worrying about me :)"*

Three days later, as soon as he got better, he rescheduled. Profusely apologizing for the cancellation.

Ricardo would never have explained. Would have canceled vaguely and gotten irritated if she questioned.

Daniel was different.

But Camila kept waiting for him to show his true face.

---

Fernanda eventually intervened.

Their coffee date. Tuesday afternoon.

"You need to stop sabotaging."

"I'm not sabotaging."

"You are. You look for flaws where there are none. Testing him constantly."

Camila knew it was true. But:

"What if just because I haven't seen a red flag YET doesn't mean it doesn't exist?"

"What if simply he IS who he seems to be? A nice guy who likes you?"

"People aren't just... nice. There is always a second motive."

Fernanda looked serious:

"No. RICARDO always had a second motive. Doesn't mean all people do."

Heavy pause.

"Ca, listen. You can protect yourself without sabotaging everything good. Give it a chance. Stop projecting."

"How to distinguish between real red flag and trauma projection?"

"Observe the pattern. Once can be anything. Multiple times is a pattern. And so far, Daniel showed only a pattern of: respect, kindness, patience."

Camila knew Fernanda was right.

But logical knowledge and emotional feeling were different things.

---

Next therapy. Dr. Lucas was more direct.

"Camila, you are being unfair."

"To whom?"

"To Daniel. And to yourself."

"How?"

"You are waiting for him to fail. Actively looking for reasons not to trust. That is not healing. That is just fear disguised as protection."

"But I need to protect myself..."

"From real harm, yes. But not from the possibility of happiness." Firm but gentle. "In every interaction you described, Daniel showed respect, clear communication, healthy boundaries. But you insist on finding a problem."

"What if I missed something?"

"WHAT IF you waste something good because you are too afraid to try?"

The question hung heavy in the air.

Dr. Lucas continued:

"Not all men are your ex. Daniel is not Ricardo. They are different people. You need to see Daniel for WHO he is. Not for who Ricardo was."

"How do I stop projecting?"

"Consciously choose to trust until given a reason not to trust. Instead of assuming the worst, assume neutral until proven otherwise."

It made sense.

Scary but made sense.

---

That night, Daniel called.

"Hi. Can I tell you something?"

"Sure."

"I notice that you are... guarded. Cautious. And I understand. I don't know the details of your past but I see the effects." Pause. "And I want you to know: I'm here without hurry. At the pace you need."

His honesty disarmed the defenses.

"I... yes. I am cautious. Past experiences made me like this."

"I can understand. And I won't pressure you to share. But I want you to know: I'm not competing with a ghost from the past. I just want to know you. The real you. If you let me."

Tears came unexpected.

Because no one had said it like that. With gentleness and patience and zero demands.

"Thank you. For being patient."

"Always. Also, wanted to ask: would you be interested in meeting my sister? She's coming to visit next week. Only if you feel comfortable, of course."

Meeting the family.

Meant he was taking it seriously.

Part of Camila wanted to panic.

But the new part—the growing part—wanted to try.

"I... think so. Would be nice."

"Great! No pressure. Just a casual dinner. She's going to love you."

After they hung up, Camila sat processing.

Daniel wanted to introduce her to his sister. Meaning he thought about the future. About her being part of his life long term.

Scary.

But also... good.

Maybe she could stop testing constantly.

Maybe she could start trusting cautiously.

Maybe Daniel really was different.

And maybe—just maybe—that was okay.

Wrote in the diary:

*"Daniel wants to introduce me to his sister.*

*Meaning he is not just casually interested.*

*Scared. Obviously.*

*But also... happy?*

*Dr. Lucas is right: not all are the ex.*

*Daniel consistently showing good things.*

*Time to stop waiting for the other shoe to drop.*

*Time to trust cautiously.*

*Because if I never trust, I will never truly connect.*

*And connection—real, healthy—is worth the risk."*

Closed the book with new resolution:

Give Daniel a real chance.

Without sabotaging.

Without projecting.

Real chance.

Because he deserved it. She deserved it. They deserved it.

And maybe that was where true healing began.
