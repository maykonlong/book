# CHAPTER 8
## I Want to Separate

The emergency room had that specific smell of ether and cheap disinfectant that turns the stomach of anyone who is already unwell.

Camila was sitting on a hard blue plastic chair, holding her purse against her chest as if it were a shield.

The doctor, Dr. Helena, had been clear. *"You have a strong virus, but your body is screaming exhaustion, my child. If you don't stop, it will stop you. Again."*

Camila left the office with a prescription for antibiotics and another for a mild anxiolytic.

She looked at the white paper in her hand.
It wasn't the body that needed to stop.
It was the life she led that needed to stop.

She checked her cell phone. Twenty missed calls from Ricardo. Ten messages.

*"Where are you?"*
*"Stop this craziness."*
*"You can't leave like this."*
*"The kids are asking."*

She didn't reply. Called an Uber.
Not to her mother's house.
To her house.

She needed to finish what she started. The note on the puddle of milk wasn't enough. She owed this to herself: to look the monster in the eye and say she was no longer afraid of it.

---

When she entered the apartment, it was two in the afternoon. The silence was absolute. The children must be at school (if Ricardo had the decency to take them).

Ricardo was in the living room.
Sitting on the sofa.
Without a cell phone in his hand, for the first time in recent history.

He stood up when he saw her.

"You came back." He seemed relieved and annoyed at the same time. "My God, Camila. What a scare. You can't just disappear!"

"I didn't disappear. I left a note."

"'I'm leaving'? Is that a note? That's terrorism, Camila! Psychological terrorism!"

He was shouting. Trying to regain control through the volume of his voice.

Camila put her purse on the kitchen counter (which was now clean, someone had wiped the milk puddle).

She was calm.
It was a frightening calm. The calm of someone who has already survived the shipwreck and now just watches the sea from afar.

"Ricardo, sit down."

"I won't sit down! You have to explain this circus to me! Leaving while sick, leaving the kids... my mother had to come pick them up!"

"Sit down." Her voice didn't change an octave. It was a low, firm command.

Ricardo stopped. Looked at her. Saw something in his wife's eyes he had never seen before. It wasn't sadness. It wasn't pleading. It was iron.

He sat down.

Camila remained standing.

"I didn't come back to stay. I came back to get more clothes and to talk to the kids when they arrive."

"What do you mean 'didn't come back to stay'? What are you talking about?"

"I want a divorce, Ricardo."

He let out a short, nervous laugh. A "hmm-hmm" of disbelief.

"Divorce. Right. Cut it out, Camila. You're sick. You have a fever. You're stressed from work. Take a few days off, go to a spa, whatever. But stop this divorce drama."

"It's not drama. And it's not from today. It's been years, Ricardo. Years that I try. Years that I ask. Years that I feel alone by your side. It's over. My quota is over."

He stood up, gesturing.

"Over what? The love? You don't love me anymore, is that it? Is there someone else?"

Always the search for the external culprit.

"There isn't someone else. And the love..." Camila thought. "The love died of hunger, Ricardo. Died of thirst. I loved you very much. I loved for two for a long time. But I got tired of loving alone."

"Loving alone... what soap opera talk! I'm here! I'm faithful! I pay the bills! I'm a good father!"

"Being a father isn't just playing on the weekend. Being a husband isn't just paying bills. You are a guest in your own life, Ricardo. You watch us live. You don't participate."

"Ah, here it comes. The 'mental load' speech. You read that on the internet, right? Those feminists putting ideas in your head."

Camila felt a twinge of anger, but let it pass. It wasn't worth it. He wouldn't understand.

"Think what you want. It's the internet's fault, my mother's, the fever's. It doesn't matter. The fact is: I don't want it anymore. I want to wake up in the morning and not have to take care of a third child of 35 years."

Ricardo turned red.

"You're going to throw eleven years in the trash? Eleven years, Camila! A family! Because of... of tiredness?"

"No. I'm going to save the rest of my life *from* the trash. Because if I stay here one more year, I will disappear. I will evaporate. And I don't want to disappear."

Ricardo changed tactics. The tone of voice lowered. Turned victim.

"And the kids? Did you think about them? You'll destroy Leo's head. Bia's. Do you want them to grow up in a broken home?"

It was the low blow. The one he knew would hurt the most.

Camila took a deep breath. Held back the tears.

"A broken home is one where the mother cries hidden in the bathroom and the father doesn't even know the name of the son's teacher. My children deserve a happy mother. And I'm not happy here."

Ricardo looked at her. Saw that the manipulation didn't work. Saw that the guilt didn't stick.

His face hardened.

"I'm not leaving here. The apartment is mine."

"It's ours. But okay. I'm going to my mother's. We'll settle the apartment in court."

"I won't give you a cent, Camila. If you walk out that door, forget it."

"I work, Ricardo. I have my salary. I don't need your money to survive. I need my peace."

He went silent.
For the first time, he realized he had nothing to threaten her with. He couldn't take the money (she worked). Couldn't take the love (she was exhausted). Couldn't take the house (it was law).

Camila went to the bedroom. Took a large suitcase. Started throwing clothes inside.

Ricardo stood at the door, watching.

"You'll regret it," he said. "You'll see how hard it is out there. Divorced woman with two kids. No one will want you."

Camila stopped. Looked at him. Smiled.

"Ricardo, do you really think I'm looking for someone to 'want' me? My biggest fantasy right now is sleeping eight hours straight and not having to wash anyone's underwear."

She closed the suitcase. Passed by him.

"I'll wait for the kids in the living room. We'll tell them together."

"I'm not telling anything." He turned his back. "The idea is yours, the problem is yours. I won't participate in this circus."

"Great," said Camila. "Better that way. Less lies for them to hear."

And went to the living room to wait.

---

The emergency room was crowded.

Camila sat on a hard plastic chair, took her ticket, and waited. Around her, the familiar chaos of a Brazilian ER: child crying, someone coughing, television on a morning show no one was watching.

She looked at her cell phone. Eight forty-five.

Three messages from Ricardo:

*"Stop the drama. Come home."*

*"You are scaring the kids."*

*"We'll talk when you stop going crazy."*

Camila blocked the phone without replying.

She wasn't going to justify herself anymore. Wasn't going to explain herself anymore. She had already done that. Five hundred times. And it didn't help.

Ticket 47. Hers was 82.

It would take a while.

Camila leaned her head against the cold wall. Fever pulsing. Body aching. But for the first time in weeks, there was something beyond the physical pain:

Clarity.

Decision.

Strange peace.

She had spoken. Had verbalized. Had let it out.

*I want a divorce.*

The words she had avoided for so long finally came out. And there was no turning back now.

Not that she wanted to.

---

Ticket 65.

Fernanda called.

"Ca? You didn't come to work?"

"I'm at the ER. Little flu."

"Flu or running away from home?"

Camila gave a humorless laugh.

"Both."

"Did something happen?"

And Camila told. The fever. The dishes. Ricardo sleeping while Leo tried to wake him. And finally, the words that came out in the kitchen:

*I want a divorce.*

Silence on the other end. Then:

"Holy shit."

"Yeah."

"How are you?"

Camila thought.

"Strangely well. Terrified. But well."

"You really said it. You actually said it."

"I did. In front of the kids. It was horrible. But... I couldn't hold it anymore."

"And him?"

"He thinks it's drama. That I'll go back on it. Messaged saying I'm 'going crazy'."

Fernanda let out a curse word.

"Typical. Until the end he'll try to make you feel crazy."

"I know. But I'm not falling for it anymore, Fer. Not anymore."

"Do you need anything? Lawyer? Place to stay?"

"Not yet. I think. I don't even know how it works. I just... I just needed to speak."

"You did right. And it's going to be okay. It's going to hurt, it's going to be hard, but you're going to be okay."

Ticket 75.

"Fer, I need to hang up. Thank you."

"Stop everything. Call me if you need, okay? Any time."

"Okay."

Camila hung up.

Ticket 80.

Camila started to rehearse mentally. What she would say when she returned home. How she would organize this. The separation. The divorce. How to explain to the kids properly. How to divide everything.

*Wait, how does one even divide when separating?*

She had no idea.

She had never really thought about it. Had avoided searching. As if not searching meant it wouldn't happen.

But now it would.

And she needed to find out how.

Ticket 82.

---

The doctor was a woman in her fifties, tired but kind.

"What are you feeling?"

Camila listed the symptoms. Fever. Throat. Body pain.

The doctor examined. Inflamed throat. Beginning of flu. Nothing serious. Prescription: rest, lots of fluids, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory.

"And you need to rest for real, see? You can't push through when the body is asking to stop."

Camila nodded. Thought: *when was the last time I really rested?*

She didn't remember.

The doctor scribbled the prescription. Stopped. Looked at Camila.

"Is everything okay with you? Besides the flu?"

Strange question. But something in the way the doctor asked made Camila answer with honesty:

"No. It isn't."

"Want to talk?"

"Don't you have other patients?"

"I do. But you look like you need to talk."

Camila didn't know what it was about the doctor. Maybe the tiredness. Maybe the fever. Maybe the fact that she was a complete stranger and precisely because of that it was easier.

But she spoke.

"I asked for a divorce this morning."

The doctor didn't seem surprised.

"And how are you with that?"

"Scared as hell. Pardon the language."

The doctor smiled.

"Small word for big feeling."

"Yeah."

"First time you asked or have you been thinking about it?"

"Have been thinking. Trying to avoid. But today... I couldn't take it anymore."

"Children?"

"Two. Eight and four years old."

The doctor nodded. Finished writing the prescription. Handed it over.

"Look, I'm not a therapist. But I've seen many women in this situation. And I can tell you one thing: if you reached the point of speaking, it's because you already passed the point of turning back. And the courage to choose yourself isn't wrong."

Camila felt tears coming.

"What if I'm doing it wrong?"

"What if you're doing it right?"

Simple. Direct.

*What if you're doing it right?*

"Rest," the doctor said, gently. "Take care of the flu. And then you organize the rest. But don't go back because you're afraid. Everyone has fear. The question is: do you want to spend the rest of your life with him or with you?"

Camila stood up. Thanked. And left.

Simple ER doctor sentence. But it gave more clarity than many elaborate conversations.

---

Pharmacy. Medicine. Water. Camila took the antipyretic right there. Sat in the car seat.

Checked her phone.

Five new messages from Ricardo. All variations of the same theme:

*"Stop the childishness."*

*"When you grow up we'll talk."*

*"I won't accept this. We MUST talk."*

Camila typed:

*"We will talk. Tonight. After the kids sleep. But my decision won't change."*

Sent.

Immediate reply:

*"You are crazy. I won't accept a divorce."*

Camila looked at the message.

*I won't accept.*

As if it were only his choice. As if she needed permission.

She typed:

*"You don't need to accept. You just need to sign."*

Blocked messages.

And drove home.

---

The house was empty when she arrived. Ricardo had taken the kids and obviously stayed out.

All the better.

Camila took a shower. Long. Hot water washing away fever, tiredness, years of stains.

Put on pajamas. Lay down.

And slept.

For the first time in weeks, slept without guilt. Without mental list. Without mental alarm ringing.

Slept deeply, heavily, curatively.

When she woke up, it was four in the afternoon.

She heard voices in the living room. There were people home.

Camila got up. Still dizzy, but better. The fever had broken. Still bad, but breathable.

Went to the living room.

Ricardo was there. And his mother, Mrs. Vera.

Great. Brought in the artillery.

Mrs. Vera looked at Camila with that face. The face of maximum disapproval.

"Camila. Need to talk to you."

"Hi, Mrs. Vera."

"Ricardo told me what you said this morning. That... absurdity."

Camila looked at Ricardo. He had the decency to look awkward. But not enough to not have called his mother.

"It's not absurdity, Mrs. Vera. It's reality."

"Reality? You who have been married for eleven years, have two beautiful children, a husband who works, who supports the house, and you want to throw everything away?"

"I'm not throwing anything away. I'm saving myself."

"Saving yourself?" Mrs. Vera almost laughed. "From what? My son gives you everything!"

"He gives me money. He doesn't give me partnership."

"Partnership? What nonsense is that, girl? Marriage isn't about partnership. It's about commitment. About enduring."

And there it was. The generation that taught that women endure. That tolerate. That stay quiet.

Camila breathed.

"Mrs. Vera, with all respect: I won't live the way you lived. I won't spend the next thirty years unhappy just to keep up appearances. I won't kill myself working to compensate for a husband who doesn't lift a finger."

"Such ingratitude! My son..."

"Your son," Camila interrupted, firmly, "forgets his own children's birthdays. Your son lets me carry everything alone. Your son saw me with fever and preferred to sleep."

Mrs. Vera looked at Ricardo. He looked away.

"That's different. Men weren't made for the house."

"Men were made to be responsible for their own children and their own lives, Mrs. Vera. And if Ricardo didn't learn that, the problem is with his upbringing, not mine."

Silence.

Mrs. Vera turned red.

Ricardo finally spoke:

"Camila, stop. You are disrespecting my mother."

"And you disrespected me for eleven years. But I didn't bring an audience to validate."

Camila looked at both of them.

"Look, I'm not going to argue this in front of your mother. But let me be clear: my decision is made. We will talk, as adults, about how it will be from now on. But there is no turning back."

"I won't sign anything," Ricardo said, trying to sound firm.

"You will. Because divorce doesn't need the agreement of both. It needs one who decided and a bunch of paperwork. And I'm going after the paperwork."

Camila turned to go back to the bedroom.

"Camila!" Mrs. Vera called. "You will regret it. Woman alone, with two kids? You think you'll find someone better?"

Camila stopped. Turned.

And smiled. Sad, but true.

"Mrs. Vera, I prefer staying alone forever than to continue feeling alone married."

And went to the bedroom.

Closed the door.

Leaned on it.

And realized:

She had done it.

Had defended. Had held the fort. Had not turned back.

And she was still standing.

Scared, but standing.

And maybe, just maybe, she was capable of staying standing.

Alone or not.

But standing.
