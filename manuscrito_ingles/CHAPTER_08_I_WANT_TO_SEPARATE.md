# CHAPTER 8 – I Want to Separate

## Chapter 8 – I Want to Separate

The emergency room smelled of that specific ether and cheap disinfectant that wraps the stomach of anyone who is already not feeling well.

Camila was sitting on a hard blue plastic chair, clutching her bag to her chest like a shield.

The doctor, Dr. Helena, had been clear:
> "You have a strong virus, but your body is screaming exhaustion, my dear. If you don’t stop, it will stop you. Again."

Camila left the office with a prescription for antibiotics and another for a light anxiolytic.

She looked at the white paper in her hand.
It wasn’t her body that needed to stop. It was the life she was living that needed to stop.

She grabbed her phone. Twenty missed calls from Ricardo. Ten messages.

> "Where are you?"
> "Stop this madness."
> "You can’t just leave."
> "The kids are asking."

She didn’t answer. She called an Uber.
Not to her mother’s house.
To her own house.

She needed to finish what she had started. The note in the milk puddle wasn’t enough. She owed herself: to face the monster head‑on and say she was no longer afraid of it.

---

When she entered the apartment it was two p.m. The silence was absolute. The kids should have been at school (if Ricardo had the decency to take them).

Ricardo was in the living room.
Sitting on the couch.
Without a phone in his hand for the first time in recent history.

He stood up when he saw her.

— "You’re back," he said, looking relieved and irritated at the same time. — "My God, Camila. What a scare. You can’t just disappear!"

— "I didn’t disappear. I left a note."

— "‘I’m leaving’? That’s a note? That’s psychological terrorism!"

He was shouting, trying to regain control by raising his voice.

Camila placed the bag on the kitchen counter (now clean, someone had wiped the milk puddle).

She was calm. It was a frightening calm – the calm of someone who has survived a shipwreck and now only watches the sea from afar.

— "Ricardo, sit down."

— "I won’t sit! You have to explain what this nonsense is! Leaving sick, leaving the kids… my mother had to pick them up!"

— "Sit," she said, her voice unchanged, a low, firm command.

Ricardo stopped. He looked at her. He saw something in his wife’s eyes he had never seen before. It wasn’t sadness. It wasn’t pleading. It was steel.

He sat.

Camila stood.

— "I didn’t come back to stay. I came back to get more clothes and to talk to the kids when they get home."

— "What do you mean ‘I didn’t come back to stay’? What are you talking about?"

— "I want a divorce, Ricardo."

He let out a short, nervous laugh, a "huh‑huh" of disbelief.

— "Divorce. Okay. Cut that, Camila. You’re sick. You have a fever. You’re stressed from work. Take a few days off, go to a spa, whatever. But stop this divorce drama."

— "It’s not drama. And it’s not new. It’s been years, Ricardo. Years I’ve tried. Years I’ve asked. Years I’ve felt alone by your side. It’s over. My quota is over."

He rose, gesturing.

— "Over what? Love? You don’t love me anymore, is that it? Is there someone else?"

The usual search for an external culprit.

— "There’s no one else. And love…" — Camila thought. — "Love died of hunger, Ricardo. Died of thirst. I loved you a lot. I loved for a long time. But I’m tired of loving alone."

— "Loving alone… what a soap‑opera line! I’m here! I’m faithful! I pay the bills! I’m a good dad!"

— "Being a dad isn’t just playing on weekends. Being a husband isn’t just paying the bills. You’re a guest in your own life, Ricardo. You watch us live. You don’t participate."

— "Ah, here we go. The ‘mental load’ speech. You read that on the internet, right? Those feminists putting a carrot in your head."

Camila felt a sting of anger but let it pass. It wasn’t worth it. He wouldn’t understand.

— "Think what you want. The internet’s fault, my mother’s fault, the fever’s fault. It doesn’t matter. The fact is: I don’t want this anymore. I don’t want to wake up in the morning and have to take care of a third‑year‑old child."

Ricardo turned red.

— "You’re going to throw eleven years in the trash? Eleven years, Camila! A family! Because of… because of fatigue?"

— "No. I’m going to save the rest of my life from the trash. Because if I stay here another year, I’ll disappear. I’ll evaporate. And I don’t want to disappear."

Ricardo changed tactics. His tone lowered. He played the victim.

— "And the kids? Did you think about them? You’ll destroy Léo’s mind. Bia’s mind. You want them to grow up in a broken home?"

It was the low blow. The thing he knew would hurt the most.

Camila breathed deeply. Held back tears.

— "A broken home is one where the mother cries hidden in the bathroom and the father doesn’t even know the kid’s teacher’s name. My kids deserve a happy mother. And I’m not happy here."

Ricardo looked at her. He saw the manipulation hadn’t worked. He saw the blame didn’t stick.

His face hardened.

— "I’m not leaving. The apartment is mine."

— "It’s ours. But fine. I’ll go to my mother’s. We’ll settle the apartment in court."

— "I won’t give you a cent, Camila. If you walk out that door, forget it."

— "I work, Ricardo. I have my salary. I don’t need your money to survive. I need my peace."

He fell silent. For the first time, he realized he had nothing to threaten her with. He couldn’t take her money (she worked). He couldn’t take her love (she was exhausted). He couldn’t take the house (the law).

Camila went to the bedroom. Grabbed a large suitcase. Started throwing clothes inside.

Ricardo stayed at the door, watching.

— "You’ll regret this," he said. — "You’ll see how hard it is out there. A divorced woman with two kids. No one will want you."

Camila stopped. Looked at him. Smiled.

— "Ricardo, do you really think I’m looking for someone to ‘want’ me? My biggest fantasy now is to sleep eight straight hours and not have to wash anyone’s underwear."

She closed the suitcase. Walked past him.

— "I’ll wait for the kids in the living room. We’ll count together."

— "I’m not counting anything," he turned his back. — "It’s your idea, the problem is yours. I won’t take part in this nonsense."

— "Great," Camila said. — "Better that way. Fewer lies for them to hear."

And she went to the living room to wait.

---

The ER was crowded.

Camila sat on a hard plastic chair, took the ticket, and waited. Around her, the familiar Brazilian family chaos: a crying child, someone coughing, a TV on a morning program nobody watched.

She looked at her phone. Eight‑forty‑five.

Three messages from Ricardo:

* "Stop the drama. Come home."
* "You’re scaring the kids."
* "We’ll talk when you stop freaking out."

Camila blocked the phone without replying.

She wasn’t going to justify herself any longer. She had done that hundreds of times. It didn’t help.

Password 47. Hers was 82.

It would take a while.

Camila leaned her head against the cold wall. Fever pulsing. Body aching. But for the first time in weeks, there was something beyond physical pain:

Clarity.

Decision.

A strange peace.

She had spoken. She had verbalized. She had let it out.

*I want a divorce.*

The words she had avoided for so long finally came out. And there was no way back now.

Not that she wanted to.

---

Password 65.

Fernanda called.

— "Hey? You didn’t come to work?"

— "I’m at the ER. A little flu."

— "Flu or running away from home?"

Camila let out a humorless laugh.

— "Both."

— "Did something happen?"

And Camila told her. The fever. The dishes. Ricardo sleeping while Léo tried to wake him. And finally, the words that left the kitchen:

*I want a divorce.*

Silence on the other side. Then:

— "Fuck."

— "Yeah."

— "How are you?"

Camila thought.

— "Strangely fine. Scared. But fine."

— "You really said it. You really said it."

— "I said it. In front of the kids. It was horrible. But… I couldn’t hold it in any longer."

— "And him?"

— "He thinks it’s drama. That I’ll backtrack. He sent a message saying I’m ‘freaking out’."

Fernanda dropped a swear word.

— "Typical. He’ll keep trying to make you feel crazy till the end."

— "I know. But I’m not falling for it anymore, Fer. Not anymore."

— "Do you need anything? Lawyer? A place to stay?"

— "Not yet. I think. I don’t even know how it works. I just… I just needed to speak."

— "You did the right thing. It’ll be okay. It’ll hurt, it’ll be hard, but you’ll be fine."

Password 75.

— "Fer, I need to hang up. Thanks."

— "Hold on. Call me if you need anything, okay? Whenever."

— "Okay."

Camila hung up.

Password 80.

Camila started rehearsing in her head what she would say when she got home. How she would organize this. The separation. The divorce. How to explain it to the kids properly. How to split everything.

*Wait, how do you split when you separate?* she wondered.

She had no idea.

She had never really thought about it. She had avoided researching. As if not researching meant it wouldn’t happen.

But now it was happening.

And she needed to figure out how.

---

The doctor was a woman in her fifties, tired but kind.

— "What are you feeling?"

Camila listed the symptoms. Fever. Sore throat. Body aches.

The doctor examined. Inflamed throat. Early flu. Nothing serious. Prescription: rest, plenty of fluids, antipyretic, anti‑inflammatory.

— "You really need to rest, okay? You can’t push through when your body is telling you to stop."

Camila nodded. Thought: *When was the last time I really rested?* She didn’t remember.

The doctor scribbled the prescription. Paused. Looked at Camila.

— "Everything okay besides the flu?"

It was a strange question. But something in the way the doctor asked made Camila answer honestly:

— "No. It’s not."

— "Want to talk?"

— "Don’t you have other patients?"

— "I do. But you seem like you need to talk."

Camila didn’t know what the doctor had. Maybe fatigue. Maybe the fever. Maybe the fact that she was a complete stranger and that made it easier.

But she spoke.

— "I asked for a divorce this morning."

The doctor didn’t look surprised.

— "And how are you handling that?"

— "Exhausted as hell."

The doctor smiled.

— "A small word for a big feeling."

— "Yeah."

— "First time you asked or have you been thinking about it?"

— "I’ve been thinking. Trying to avoid it. But today… I couldn’t take it any longer."

— "Kids?"

— "Two. Eight and four years old."

The doctor nodded. Finished the prescription. Handed it over.

— "Look, I’m not a therapist. But I’ve seen many women in this situation. And I can tell you one thing: if you got to the point of saying it, you’ve already passed the point of turning back. And having the courage to choose yourself isn’t wrong."

Camila felt tears coming.

— "What if I’m doing it wrong?"

— "What if you’re doing it right?"

Simple. Direct.

— "If you’re doing it right?"

— "Rest," the doctor said gently. — "Take care of the flu. Then you’ll sort out the rest. But don’t turn back because you’re scared. Everyone’s scared. The question is: do you want to spend the rest of your life with him or with yourself?"

Camila got up. Thanked her. And left.

A simple ER prescription, but it gave more clarity than many elaborate conversations.

---

Pharmacy. Meds. Water. Camila took the antipyretic right there. Sat on the car seat.

She looked at her phone.

Five new messages from Ricardo. All variations of the same theme:

* "Stop being childish."
* "When you mature we’ll talk."
* "I won’t accept this. We HAVE to talk."

Camila typed:

* "We’ll talk tonight after the kids are asleep. But my decision won’t change."

Sent.

Immediate reply:

* "You’re crazy. I won’t accept divorce."

Camila looked at the message.

*I won’t accept.*

As if it were his only choice. As if she needed his permission.

She typed:

* "You don’t need to accept. You just need to sign."

Blocked the messages.

And drove home.

---

The house was empty when she arrived. Ricardo had taken the kids and obviously was out.

Much better.

Camila took a shower. Long. Hot water washing away fever, fatigue, years of bruises.

She put on pajamas. Lied down.

And slept.

For the first time in weeks, she slept without guilt. Without a mental list. Without a mental alarm ringing.

She slept deeply, heavily, curatively.

When she woke, it was four p.m.

She heard voices in the living room. People were in the house.

Camila got up. Still dizzy but better. The fever had broken. She was still unwell but breathable.

She went to the living room.

Ricardo was there. And his mother, Dona Vera.

Great. They brought the artillery.

Dona Vera looked at Camila with that face. The face of maximum disapproval.

— "Camila. I need to talk to you."

— "Hi, Dona Vera."

— "Ricardo told me what you said this morning. That… absurd thing."

Camila looked at Ricardo. He had the decency to look awkward. But not enough to not have called his mother.

— "It’s not absurd, Dona Vera. It’s reality."

— "Reality? You’ve been married eleven years, have two beautiful kids, a husband who works, who supports the house, and you want to throw it all away?"

— "I’m not throwing anything away. I’m saving myself."

— "Saving yourself?" — Dona Vera almost laughed. — "From what? My son gives you everything!"

— "He gives me money. He doesn’t give me partnership."

— "Partnership? What a fancy word, girl. Marriage isn’t about partnership. It’s about commitment. About endurance."

And there it was. The generation that taught women to endure. To tolerate. To stay silent.

Camila breathed.

— "Dona Vera, with all respect: I will not live the way you lived. I will not spend the next thirty years unhappy just to keep appearances. I will not kill myself working to compensate a husband who doesn’t lift a finger."

— "How ungrateful! My son…"

— "Your son — Camila interrupted, firm — forgets his own kids’ birthdays. Your son makes me carry everything alone. Your son saw me with a fever and chose to sleep."

Dona Vera looked at Ricardo. He looked away.

— "That’s different. Men weren’t made for the home."

— "Men were made to be responsible for their own kids and their own life, Dona Vera. And if Ricardo didn’t learn that, the problem is the upbringing, not me."

Silence.

Dona Vera turned red.

Ricardo finally spoke:

— "Camila, stop. You’re disrespecting my mother."

— "And you disrespected me for eleven years. But I didn’t bring an audience to validate."

Camila looked at the two.

— "Look, I’m not going to argue about this in front of your mother. But let me be clear: my decision is made. We’ll talk, like adults, about how things will be from now on. But there’s no going back."

— "I won’t sign anything," Ricardo said, trying to sound firm.

— "You will. Because a divorce doesn’t need both parties’ agreement. It needs one who decides and a lot of paperwork. And I’ll get the paperwork."

Camila turned to go back to the bedroom.

— "Camila!" — Dona Vera called. — "You’ll regret this. A single woman with two kids? You think you’ll find someone better?"

Camila stopped. Turned.

— "Dona Vera, I’d rather be alone forever than keep feeling alone married."

And she went to the bedroom.

She closed the door.

Leaning against it.

She realized:

She had done it. She had defended. She had held the line. She hadn’t backed down.

And she was still standing.

Scared, but standing.

And maybe, just maybe, she could keep standing.

Alone or not.

But standing.
