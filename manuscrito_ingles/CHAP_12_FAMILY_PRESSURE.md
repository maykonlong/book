# CHAPTER 12
## Family Pressure

Sunday is the official family day. And, consequently, the official judgment day for those who broke the family.

The phone rang at 9 AM. The name "MOM" shone on the screen like a dangerous neon sign.

Camila was in bed, enjoying the rare luxury of waking up without an alarm (the kids were with Ricardo). She answered with a voice hoarse from sleep.

"Hello?"
"Camila. Good morning."
"Good morning, mom."
"You're coming to lunch, right? I won't take no for an answer. The aunts will be here. Cida, Bete, Vilma. They want to see you."

Camila closed her eyes.
Aunt Cida, Aunt Bete, and Aunt Vilma. The triumvirate of judgment. Her father's sisters, who always considered Ricardo a "saint" for having married their niece.

"Mom... I don't know if I'm in the mood."
"Camila, don't run away. You need to face this sometime. Come. I made lasagna."
"Okay, mom. Noon."

She hung up.
Felt her stomach turn. It wasn't hunger for lasagna. It was fear of emotional indigestion.

She arrived at her mother's house in Santo Amaro at noon sharp. The smell of roast invaded the building hallway.

When she entered, she was greeted by the familiar noise of female voices talking all at the same time.

"There she is!" shouted Aunt Cida, the oldest, with her mahogany-dyed hair and red lipstick that always smudged on her teeth.
"Wow, how she's lost weight!" commented Aunt Bete, the "fitness" of the family (who lived on soup diets).
"She looks haggard, poor thing," completed Aunt Vilma, the official pessimist.

Camila gave a yellow smile, kissed the three of them, kissed her mother (who was in the kitchen, tense, checking the oven), and sat on the sofa.

The interrogation began before the grape juice.

"And the kids?" asked Cida.
"With their father."
"Ah, so he's taking them? That's good. Because men usually disappear when they separate, right? Ricardo no, Ricardo is solid."

First jab. *Ricardo is solid.* The same Ricardo who forgot his son's birthday.

"He's the father, aunt. It's his obligation."

"Obligation nothing, nowadays it's a favor!" retorted Bete. "My neighbor separated and the husband never saw the boy's face again. You have to raise your hands to the sky that Ricardo is a good father."

Camila took a deep breath. *Don't take the bait. Don't take the bait.*

They went to the table. The lasagna was great, as always. But Camila could barely swallow.

"And how did it happen, my daughter?" asked Vilma, serving herself more salad. "We were so surprised. You seemed so good at Christmas."

"We weren't good at Christmas, aunt. We were pretending well."

"But separating like this, suddenly..." Cida shook her head. "There was no cheating, was there?"
"No."
"Was it money?"
"No."
"Then what was it? Tiredness?" Cida laughed. "If everyone separated because of tiredness, there wouldn't be a couple left in the world, my daughter. Marriage is tiring indeed. It's normal."

"Is it normal for the husband not to know the date of his children's birthday?" Camila let out. Couldn't hold it. "Is it normal for the woman to work outside, take care of the house, the kids, the social agenda, the bills, and the husband to arrive and ask 'what's for dinner'? If that's normal, aunt, then I prefer to be abnormal."

Silence fell on the table. That silence of cutlery hitting china.

Mrs. Sonia, at the head of the table, continued eating slowly.

"But Camila," insisted Bete, the gentle voice of someone explaining the obvious to a child. "Men are just like that. They don't have a knack for domestic things. It's up to the woman to guide. Gently. You've always been a bit... hot-headed."

"Hot-headed?" Camila felt tears coming. "I endured eleven years, aunt! Eleven years asking for help. Eleven years feeling alone accompanied. Is that being hot-headed?"

"Ah, but he didn't drink, didn't beat you..." started Vilma.

THAT WAS IT.
That was when Mrs. Sonia, the quiet mother, the standard widow, the woman who always served everyone in silence, dropped her fork on her plate.
The noise was loud. *Clang!*

All looked at her.

"Enough," said Mrs. Sonia. Low voice, but firm.

"What is it, Sonia?" asked Cida.

"Enough saying Ricardo was a saint because he didn't beat her." Mrs. Sonia looked at her sisters-in-law. "Jorge didn't beat me either. And Jorge didn't drink. And Jorge worked."

Jorge was Camila's father. The "saint" brother of the aunts.

"But I spent forty years married to Jorge," continued Mrs. Sonia, her voice trembling slightly, "serving coffee in the cup he liked, ironing the shirt the way he wanted, being silent when he watched the news. And in forty years, he never, *never* asked me if I was happy. He never knew what my favorite flower was. He never noticed when I cut my hair, except to complain about the price."

The aunts were open-mouthed. Camila too.

"Jorge was a good man," said Sonia, looking into the void. "But he erased me. Little by little. Every day he erased a piece of me with his indifference. And I let him. Because I thought that was how it was. That women endure."

She looked at Camila. Her mother's eyes were full of water.

"I don't want my daughter to be erased."

Nobody said anything.

"Camila is right," concluded Mrs. Sonia, picking up her fork again. "Not having been beaten is the minimum, not a merit. If she was unhappy, she was right to leave. Before she became like me: widow of a husband who never really knew her."

Camila looked at her mother across the table.
Saw, for the first time, not "Mrs. Sonia", the perfect and controlled mother. Saw Sonia. The woman. The woman who had also been Camila one day.

"Thank you, mom," whispered Camila.

"Eat your lasagna, daughter," said Sonia, voice choked. "It's going to get cold."

The rest of the lunch was about the weather, soap operas, the price of tomatoes.
Nobody talked about Ricardo anymore.
His ghost had been exorcised by the matriarch's confession.

And Camila realized that, by saving herself, she had, somehow, avenged her mother's silence too.

Mrs. Sonia called on Sunday morning.

Camila was having coffee alone—the kids had stayed with Ricardo for the weekend—when the phone rang. Her mother's name on the screen.

She hesitated before answering. Knew what was coming.

"Hello, mom."

"Good morning, daughter." The voice was that one. Formal. Serious. "I need to talk to you."

"Okay. Speak."

"In person. Today. Come have lunch here."

It wasn't an invitation. It was a summons. The tone Mrs. Sonia used when "talk" meant "lecture".

Camila thought about inventing an excuse. Saying she had an appointment, was busy, anything.

But it was no use. Mothers always know when they are being avoided. And avoiding would only make it worse.

"What time?"

"Noon. I'm going to make that lasagna you like."

Lasagna. Mrs. Sonia's secret weapon. Food as affection and as emotional blackmail.

"Okay. Noon."

Camila hung up and looked at the cup of cold coffee in front of her.

She knew exactly how it would be. Her mother would ask about Ricardo. Would suggest she was being hasty. Would talk about commitment, about the kids, about "what people will think".

Camila took a deep breath.

She had to go. Had to face it.

But God, how she didn't want to.

---

Mrs. Sonia's house was in Santo Amaro. Small two-bedroom apartment where she lived alone since her husband—Camila's father—had passed away five years ago.

Camila rang the bell at noon sharp.

Her mother opened. Sixty years old, short hair dyed blonde, reading glasses hanging around her neck, flowered apron.

"Hi, mom."

"Come in, daughter."

Quick hug. Protocol.

The house smelled of lasagna. And tension.

"Sit. I'm just going to take it out of the oven."

Camila sat in the living room. Looked around. Everything impeccable, as always. Mrs. Sonia had that GIFT of keeping everything perfectly tidy. Of appearing that everything was right even when it wasn't.

Camila had inherited that. The skill—or curse—of making everything seem under control while crumbling inside.

Her mother brought trays. Lasagna, salad, juice. Served both plates. Sat down.

They ate in silence for a few minutes.

Then Mrs. Sonia got straight to the point:

"And Ricardo?"

Camila chewed slowly. Swallowed. Drank juice.

"At the aparthotel. Like I told you."

"How long has it been?"

"A month."

"And when does he come back?"

Camila put her fork on the table. Looked at her mother.

"He's not coming back, mom. We are separating. For real."

Mrs. Sonia sighed. That long, tired sigh, full of unspoken meaning.

"Daughter... don't you think you're exaggerating a little bit?"

*Exaggerating.*

Always that word. As if her feelings were always too much. Too big. Too dramatic.

"No, mom. I don't think so."

"But you barely tried! Couples therapy, counseling, whatever..."

"I suggested therapy. He refused."

"But did you insist?"

Camila felt irritation rising.

"I insisted for eleven years, mom. I tried to talk, tried to change, tried to do things differently. I got tired."

"But marriage is forever, Camila. Marriage isn't about feeling. It's about commitment."

And there it was. The philosophy of Mrs. Sonia's generation. Marriage as a gilded cage. As obligation. As something you endure regardless of everything.

"Mom..." Camila took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. "My marriage was killing me."

"What exaggeration, Camila."

"It's not exaggeration! I was exhausted, invisible, alone. I asked for help and he ignored. I begged for him to see me and he didn't see. I tried every way and it didn't work."

"But what about the kids?" Her mother played the card Camila knew would come. "Did you think about the kids?"

Guilt hammered. As it always hammered.

"I think about the kids every day, mom. It was for them, too, that I left."

Mrs. Sonia frowned.

"What do you mean for them? Children need father and mother together!"

"Children need happy parents. Even if separated." Camila leaned in. "Mom, Leo was eight years old and was already taking on adult responsibilities because his father didn't take them on. Bia sensed the tension and got anxious. They were feeling everything. And it would get worse if I stayed."

"But at least they would have a whole family."

"We were never a whole family, mom. We were me, the kids, and a stranger living in the same house. That's not a family. It's a facade."

Mrs. Sonia fell silent. Poked the lasagna on her plate.

Camila continued, softer:

"Mom, I know you grew up in another time. That you learned that women endure, that marriage is sacrifice, that happiness is a luxury. But I don't want that for me. I don't want Bia growing up thinking she has to annul herself for a man. I don't want Leo thinking a husband doesn't need to be a partner."

"You know," Mrs. Sonia spoke, finally, voice lower, "when I married your father, I was very much like you. Had dreams. Wanted things. But I learned quickly that marriage was about yielding. Always yielding. And I yielded so much that..." she stopped. Eyes tearing up. "I yielded so much that I forgot who I was."

Camila had never heard her mother speak like that. So... honest. So vulnerable.

"I stayed silent for forty years," Mrs. Sonia continued. "Doing everything. Carrying everything. And do you know when I realized I had lost myself? When your father died. And suddenly I was alone and didn't even know what I liked to eat for breakfast. Because I always made what he liked."

Tears flowed.

"Forty years, Camila. I wasted forty years being invisible in my own life."

Camila got up. Went to her mother. Hugged her.

And they cried together.

When they separated, Mrs. Sonia wiped her eyes.

"That's why I supported you that day you came here. Remember? You said you were considering separating and I didn't fight."

"You didn't fight. But I thought you disapproved."

"I was afraid. Afraid that you would regret it. Afraid that you would face hardship. Afraid of the judgment of others." She took her daughter's hand. "But then I saw you. Saw how broken you were. And I thought: I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to spend forty years erasing herself."

Camila cried again.

"Thank you, mom."

"But promise one thing."

"What?"

"Promise that you won't use this divorce to close yourself off. To never trust again. To never allow yourself to love again."

Camila didn't know if she could promise that. But she nodded.

"I will try."

"Try." Mrs. Sonia squeezed her hand. "Because you deserve true love. Love that chooses you every day. Love that sees you."

"And if I don't find it?"

"Then you find yourself. And that is already more than having someone by your side who makes you feel alone."

They stayed like that. Mother and daughter. Women who carried worlds alone.

Understanding each other for the first time in a long time.

---

Later, when Camila was leaving, Mrs. Sonia stopped at the door:

"Oh, and Camila?"

"Yes?"

"About what people will think..." She gave a little smile. "Fuck them."

Camila widened her eyes. Her mother never, NEVER, spoke a curse word.

Mrs. Sonia laughed.

"I learned that recently. At sixty. Better late than never."

And Camila left her mother's house with something she didn't have when she arrived:

True support.

And permission—from her mother and from herself—to move on.

Without guilt.

Or at least, with a little less guilt.

And that was already a start.
