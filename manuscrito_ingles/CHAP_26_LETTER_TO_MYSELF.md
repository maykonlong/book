# CHAPTER 26
## Letter To Myself

Camila found her old diary. The one from the beginning of everything.
Black cover. First page dated two years ago.

She read the old entries.
*"I feel alone even with him by my side."*
*"Am I crazy?"*
*"Cried in the shower again."*

The pain of that Camila jumped from the pages. A raw, desperate pain, of an animal caught in a trap.

Camila picked up a new pen.
Went to the last blank page.
And wrote a reply. A letter to that woman of the past.

---

*Dear Camila from two years ago,*

*I know you are afraid. I know you think that if you leave, you will die. That you will destroy your children's lives. That you will be alone forever and that no one will ever love you again.*

*I am writing from the future to tell you: it will hurt.*
*It will hurt like childbirth. It will tear you in half.*
*You will cry on the kitchen floor. You will feel poor. You will doubt everything.*

*But, please, jump.*

*Jump off this cliff.*
*Because you won't fall.*
*You will learn to fly.*

*I wish you could see us now.*
*You paint pictures, Ca. Beautiful pictures that people buy.*
*You have a boyfriend (Daniel!) who listens when you speak and finds it sexy when you are in pajamas reading.*
*Your children are happy. They learned resilience.*

*But the main thing:*
*You laugh.*
*Not that polite smile for visitors. But belly-aching laughter.*
*You like your own company.*

*Don't be afraid of loneliness. Loneliness was the womb where we were reborn.*
*Resist. Endure the initial pain. Sign that paper.*

*The half you think you will lose isn't yours.*
*The half you are missing... is me.*
*And I am here, waiting for you on the other side of fear.*

*With love,*
*Your whole Camila.*

Camila closed the notebook.
A tear fell on the cover. Not of sadness.
Of reverence.
For the woman she had to kill so this one could live.
And for the woman she had the courage to become.
