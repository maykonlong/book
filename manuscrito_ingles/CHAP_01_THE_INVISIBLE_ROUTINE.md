# CHAPTER 1
## The Invisible Routine

Have you ever woken up tired?

I don't mean that physical tiredness from running a marathon or cleaning the whole house on Sunday. I mean a tiredness that seems to live in the marrow of your bones. That type of exhaustion that is already there, sitting on your chest, the exact second you open your eyes, waiting for you like an unwanted visitor that never leaves.

Camila knew this type of tiredness well. It had become her most faithful companion, more constant even than the husband sleeping beside her.

It was 5:53 AM.

The cell phone alarm hadn't gone off yet—seven exact minutes remained—but Camila's eyes opened on their own. Her body had developed a cruel biological clock, trained by cortisol and anxiety, that woke her before the alarm just so she had time to *feel* the weight of the day ahead.

The room was in the bluish gloom of pre-morning. The air conditioner hummed softly, a sound that used to relax her, but now seemed like just more white noise in a mind that never switched off.

Beside her, Ricardo slept the sleep of the just. Or rather, the sleep of the exempt.

He was turned on his back, occupying two-thirds of the king-size bed, with the duvet bundled between his legs. His breathing was heavy, rhythmic, deep. Camila lay there, motionless, watching her husband's broad back. An acidic envy was rising in her throat.

How did he do it? How did he manage to switch off the world like that? How did he not wake up wondering if there was bread for the kids' snacks, if Leo's uniform had dried in time, if the 10 AM meeting would conflict with the quarterly report delivery?

Camila had a sudden, almost childish urge to kick his shin. To shake him by the shoulders and scream: *"WAKE UP! Life is happening and I'm carrying it alone!"*

But she didn't do that.

Of course not.

Instead, she performed her first act of the day: the silent exit. She slid out of bed with the lightness of an exhausted ballerina, stepping onto the cold porcelain floor that sent a thermal shock up her spine. Better that way. It helped to wake up.

She gathered the silk robe that had fallen on the armchair in the corner—the same armchair where Ricardo had thrown his work pants the night before, ignoring the laundry basket two meters away. Camila picked up his pants automatically. She didn't think. She didn't complain. She just picked them up and put them in the basket.

It was a small, invisible gesture. The first of a thousand she would make in the next twelve hours.

Six minutes to the alarm.

Camila went to the bathroom and locked the door. That click of the lock was the most comforting sound of her morning. There, in that space of three square meters, she could be just Camila. Not Leo and Bia's mom. Not Ricardo's wife. Not the marketing coordinator. Just a woman washing her face.

She turned on the tap and splashed cold water on her cheeks. She looked at herself in the mirror.

The dark circles were there, deep and purplish, like bruises from a fight no one saw. There were new fine lines around her eyes, marks of someone who spent too much time frowning in worry.

"You can do this," she whispered to her reflection. But her voice came out hoarse, without conviction. "It's just another Tuesday."

Quick shower. Timed. Seven minutes of hot water to try to loosen the knots in her shoulders. Three minutes to dry off. Two minutes to tie her still-damp hair in a "messy" bun that, in truth, was merely practical.

Twelve minutes. It had to be that way. Because if she took fifteen, the gears would jam. The snacks wouldn't be ready. Breakfast would be late. The kids would be late. Traffic would jam. The world would end.

Or at least, that's how it seemed.

---

The kitchen was immersed in that tense silence that precedes the storm.

Camila loved that moment. She loved the smell of freshly opened coffee powder. She loved the sound of the water bubbling in the electric kettle. It was her ritual. The only moment where she controlled all the variables.

While the coffee brewed, Camila's mind began to run the "List." The damn Mental List that never ended. It unrolled in her head like those infinite scrolls from old movies:

*1. Leo's lunchbox (he said he's sick of apples, try chopped pear).*
*2. Bia's uniform (check if the ink stain came out).*
*3. Thaw the chicken for dinner (if I forget, we'll have to order pizza again and Ricardo will complain about the expense).*
*4. Pay the electric bill (due today, set a reminder).*
*5. Reply to the annoying client's email about the Christmas campaign.*
*6. Schedule the kids' dentist.*
*7. Buy a gift for Leo's friend's party on Saturday.*
*8. Where is the shopping list? We're out of milk. Cheese too.*

Camila opened the fridge and sighed. There were only two slices of cheese.

"Great," she murmured. "Leo gets the cheese, Bia will have to eat cream cheese."

Her movements were mechanical, efficient. Cut the bread. Spread butter. Cut the fruit. Fill the water bottles. Pack everything in the thermal lunchboxes with their favorite characters—Sonic for him, Paw Patrol for her.

She mentally crossed off two items from the list. Only eight hundred to go.

Seven fifteen.

Battle time.

Camila went to the laundry area, where the backpacks were already "magically" ready (thanks to her, at 11 PM the night before). She grabbed the ironed and folded uniforms.

She breathed deep, filling her lungs with air and courage, and headed to the hallway.

Leo's room smelled of boy—an indefinable mixture of crayons, night sweat, and sneakers. He was wrapped in the blanket like a cocoon, only a tuft of brown hair visible.

Camila sat on the edge of the bed. Her hand, instinctively, went to stroke his head. It was in these moments, watching her children sleep, that the guilt diminished and the love overflowed, reminding her of why she made all that effort.

"Good morning, my love. Time to wake up."

A muffled groan.

"Five minutes, mom..." His voice was draggy, thick with sleep.

"You know we don't have five minutes, son. Let's go. The sun is already up."

Lie. The day was cloudy, leaden gray, typical of São Paulo in January. But "the sun is already up" sounded more optimistic.

Leo moved, uncovering his crumpled face. He opened just one eye, fixing his mother with that brutal honesty of children.

"You look tired, mom."

Camila froze. The smile congealed on her face.

It was painful how children saw everything. Ricardo could go days without noticing she had cut her hair or that she was crying in the shower, but Leo, with his eight years, saw her dark circles in three seconds.

"It's just sleep, dear. Mommy didn't sleep much. Go on, get up. Uniform on the chair."

In the room next door, the battle was different. Bia, with her four years and empress personality, was already awake, sitting on the bed, with hair looking like a nest of rebellious birds.

"I don't want to go to school today," she decreed, crossing her tiny arms over her unicorn pajamas.

"Good morning to you too, Your Highness," Camila joked, reaching for the uniform. "And why not?"

"Because Luana isn't my friend anymore. She didn't lend me the pink crayon."

"I'm sure she'll lend it today. Come on, let's put on this beautiful dress."

"I don't want a dress! I want the polka dot pants!"

"The polka dot pants are in the wash, Bia."

"THEN I WON'T GO!"

The high-pitched scream pierced Camila's eardrum. She closed her eyes for a second. Counted to three. Didn't work. Counted to five.

"Beatriz," her tone dropped an octave. The dreaded "Serious Mom Voice." "We are not discussing this right now. Dress. Now."

The girl huffed, but obeyed. Camila dressed her daughter with the efficiency of someone dressing an articulated doll that resists movement. Combing hair was another complex diplomatic negotiation, involving promises of watching cartoons on the tablet for ten minutes tonight.

Seven twenty-eight.

Camila returned to the kitchen pulling the two children, now dressed and reasonably presentable. She poured cereal into bowls. Served the milk.

And that was when Ricardo appeared.

He entered the kitchen scratching his belly, wearing only boxer shorts and a worn-out college t-shirt that Camila had been trying to throw away for five years. His hair was mashed on one side only, giving him a comical look if it weren't tragic.

He walked straight past Camila.

No kiss. No "good morning." No touch on the shoulder.

He went straight to the thermos. Poured a steaming mug. Took a noisy sip and made a face.

"Wow. It's strong today, huh?" he complained, looking at the mug as if it had personally offended him.

Camila, who was wiping up a drop of milk Bia had spilled on the table, felt her blood heat up.

"Good morning to you too, Ricardo."

He blinked, seeming to notice her for the first time.

"Ah. Good morning." He looked at the kids. "What's up, monsters? Ready for school?"

Leo smiled with his mouth full. Bia ignored him, still sulking about the lack of polka dot pants.

Ricardo leaned against the counter, drinking his coffee calmly. With an irritating calm. With the calm of someone who knows they don't need to worry about the schedule because *someone* is managing the schedule.

"Have you seen my blue shirt? The one with thin stripes?" he asked.

"It's on the hanger, on the wardrobe door. I ironed it last night," Camila replied, without taking her eyes off the clock. Seven thirty-five. They were late.

"Ah. Thanks." He yawned. "I'm gonna take a shower."

Camila stopped.

"Ricardo, are you taking a shower now? I need to leave with the kids in five minutes."

"Well, leave. I'll go later. Meeting's only at nine-thirty."

Of course. His meeting was at nine-thirty. His time was elastic. Hers was a ticking time bomb.

Ricardo went to the bathroom. Camila heard the sound of the shower turning on.

She looked at her own cup of coffee, untouched, on the counter. It was cold.

She picked up the cup and downed the cold, bitter liquid all at once, as if it were medicine. Maybe it was. Caffeine to keep the machine running.

"Let's go, kids. Brush teeth. Fast!"

---

Traffic on Rebouças Avenue was the physical representation of Camila's mental state: chaotic, noisy, and gridlocked.

Bia sang "Let It Go" in the back seat, singing off-key with conviction. Leo looked out the window, too quiet for an eight-year-old.

"Everything okay back there, son?" she asked, adjusting the rearview mirror to see his eyes.

"Dad forgot to sign my agenda," he said, quietly.

Camila's heart tightened.

"What was in the agenda?"

"The note about the excursion. Had to hand it in today."

"Why didn't you ask me, Leo?"

"The teacher said it was for dad or mom. I asked dad yesterday when he arrived. He said 'I'll see it later'."

Camila gripped the steering wheel with such force that her knuckles turned white.

*I'll see it later.* Ricardo's mantra. His "later" meant "never." It meant "Camila will see it later and solve it."

"Don't worry, love. When we get there, mommy will sign it. I'll go down with you."

"But the parking spot is bad, mom..."

"No problem. Mommy will find a way. Mommy always finds a way."

She parked in a prohibited spot, turned on the hazard lights, ran with Leo to the gate, signed the note leaning the paper against the wall, gave a kiss on his sweaty forehead, and ran back before she got a fine.

She dropped Bia at the preschool gate. More kisses. More little waves.

Returned to the car.

It was eight fifteen.

The silence of the car, now empty, fell over her like a lead cloak.

There was no Frozen music. No complaints about crayons. Just the hum of the engine and her own short breathing.

Camila rested her forehead on the steering wheel for a second. Just a second. She allowed herself to close her eyes.

The urge to cry came fast and violent, rising up her chest. But she pushed it down. Swallowed the cry along with her saliva.

*Not now. You have a meeting.*
*Not now. If you cry, you'll ruin your makeup and you forgot your mascara at home.*
*Not now.*

She lifted her head, looked at herself in the rearview mirror, fixed a loose strand of hair, and shifted into first gear.

The office awaited her. The spreadsheets awaited her. The demands awaited her.

Camila—the woman, the dreamer, the artist she used to be—would have to wait a little longer. Maybe forever.

She accelerated, blending in with the thousands of other gray cars on the gray avenue, in one more gray day of her invisible life.

---

The day at the office was that frantic blur of someone working in an agency or modern marketing departments. "Urgent" was everyone's favorite word.

Everything was "for yesterday."
"Camila, we need to approve the layout."
"Camila, the client didn't like the font."
"Camila, the performance report is down."

She solved everything. Put out fires with the competence of someone who has been doing this for years. She was good at what she did. Very good. Organized, creative, agile.

At three in the afternoon, her cell phone vibrated on the desk.

It was a message from Ricardo.

*"Love, remember I have soccer with the guys from work today? Won't be home for dinner."*

Camila looked at the illuminated screen.

Soccer. On a Tuesday.

She typed: *"Ok. Have fun."*

Deleted.

Typed: *"But you said you'd help with Leo's homework today."*

Deleted.

He wouldn't remember that he said that. And if he did remember, he would say soccer was important for "networking."

She typed only: *"Okay."*

Locked the screen. Felt that bitter taste in her mouth that had nothing to do with the bad pantry coffee. It was the taste of resignation.

At five thirty, she left running. Literally ran to the parking lot. The return traffic was worse. The anxiety of the "second shift" was starting to hit.

Pick up kids. Traffic. Listen to how the day went. Traffic. Get home.

The apartment door opened at 6:45 PM.

The scene was the same as always. The house was empty and silent, but the sofa cushions still held the shape of Ricardo's body from the morning. His coffee cup remained on the counter, now with a crust of dried milk on the rim.

He hadn't even put it in the sink.

Camila looked at that cup.

It was just a cheap white ceramic cup with a chip on the rim. But, in that moment, illuminated by the yellow kitchen light, it seemed like a monument to neglect.

"Go get changed, Leo. Bia, take off your sneakers," she commanded, her voice coming out automatic.

While the children went to their rooms, Camila went to the cup. Picked it up. The rest of the cold coffee sloshed inside it.

She had the urge to throw the cup against the wall. Imagined the ceramic exploding, the little shards flying, the brown coffee stain running down the beige wallpaper. Imagined the noise. The crash. The fright.

It would be liberating.

But who would clean up after?

Her.

Always her.

So, Camila just sighed, defeated. Poured the coffee in the sink, washed the cup with water and detergent, and put it in the drainer.

"Mom! I'm hungry!" Bia shouted from the living room.

"Coming, honey!" she shouted back.

She opened the fridge. Took out the thawed chicken. Grabbed the cutting board. Grabbed the knife.

And started all over again.

Cut. Sauté. Stir. Serve. Clean. Bathe. Dry hair. Read story. Goodnight kiss. Turn off the light.

When Camila finally sat on the sofa, it was ten thirty at night.

The house was in order. The children were sleeping. Ricardo's dinner (which she had left ready, just in case he arrived hungry from soccer) was in the microwave.

She was alone in the living room.

The silence now wasn't tense. It was heavy. Crushing.

Camila heard the key turn in the door.

Ricardo entered. He smelled of locker room soap and cheap male deodorant, with a faint background of beer. He was flushed, animated, energized by the exercise and the company of friends.

"Hey, love!" He smiled, throwing his sports bag on the floor (on the floor!). "Tired?"

Camila looked at him. At his sweaty, happy face. At the bag in the middle of the clean living room.

"I am," she said. Just that.

"Ah, soccer today was intense. Scored two goals. The guys set up a barbecue for the weekend."

He went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, grabbed a bottle of water. Came back drinking from the bottle.

"Kids already sleeping?"

"Yeah."

"Cool. I'm going to bed. I'm dead."

He passed by her, gave a loud, damp kiss on the top of her head—the way one kisses a piece of furniture or a beloved pet—and went to the bedroom.

"Not coming to bed?" he shouted from the hallway.

"In a bit," Camila replied.

But she didn't go.

She stayed there, sitting in the dark living room, listening to the tick-tock of the wall clock that seemed to count the seconds of her life draining down the drain.

She looked at her own hands resting on her lap. Hands that had changed diapers, typed reports, cleaned cups, driven cars, caressed fevers, held the world.

Hands that trembled slightly.

Camila asked herself, with a morbid and frightening curiosity:

*If I disappeared tomorrow... how long would it take Ricardo to notice the toilet paper doesn't replace itself in the holder?*

She didn't know the answer.

And in that moment, with the darkness of the room embracing her like a cold blanket, Camila realized that the worst part wasn't the physical tiredness. It wasn't the dark circles. It wasn't the endless list.

The worst part was the loneliness.

The accompanied loneliness. The loneliness of sleeping next to someone who didn't know the color of your toothbrush or the name of your anguish.

Camila stood up, turned off the last light, and walked to the room, dragging her feet and her soul, ready to sleep little and wake up seven minutes before the alarm, to do it all over again.

Invisible.
Indispensable.
And completely alone.
