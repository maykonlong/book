# CHAPTER 14 – The New Routine

## Chapter 14 – The New Routine

The house has a cruel way of reminding a newly divorced woman that she is alone. It’s not the big voids; it’s the tiny maintenance tasks.

A week after Ricardo left, the kitchen faucet started dripping. *Plink – plink – plink.* The sound of hell.

In a married life, Camila would have said, “Ricardo, the sink is leaking.” He would have grumbled, stalled for three days, and finally fixed it (or called someone). It would have been his problem to solve.

Now it was hers.

Camila stared at the faucet, then at the toolbox Ricardo had left behind (probably because he bought a new one for his new life).

— “I can handle this,” she shouted into the empty kitchen.

She opened YouTube and typed *"How to fix a leaking faucet easily"*. A five‑minute video showed how to turn off the valve, unscrew the aerator, replace the rubber gasket.

She went to the hardware store. The clerk gave her the classic look, *"You sure you know what you’re doing?"*.

— "I need a Deca faucet rubber seal," she said, reading the note she’d written.

Two reais later, she was back home, wrestling with a stubborn valve, cursing three generations of the manufacturer’s family.

She unscrewed the faucet, water sprayed, soaked her shirt.

— "Shit," she muttered, but kept going, swapping the gasket and re‑threading the faucet.

When she turned the valve back on, the faucet exploded—not like a bomb, but water spurted everywhere: ceiling, cabinets, her face.

— "FUCK!" she screamed, slipping on the puddle, scrambling to shut the valve.

Silence returned. The kitchen was flooded, Camila drenched, hair plastered to her forehead.

She sat on the wet floor, the urge to cry overwhelming.

*I can’t do this. I’m a fraud. I need a man. I need help.*

She lifted the phone to call Ricardo. The finger hovered over his name. It would have been so easy: "Ricardo, help, I messed up the kitchen." He would come, fix it, look down at her with that condescending superiority: *"See? You can’t do it without me."*

Camila stared at the phone, then at the murderous faucet, and with cold anger slammed the phone onto the counter.

— "Not a chance," she whispered.

She stood, dried her face on a wet sleeve, replayed the video, looking for her mistake. She’d over‑tightened the thread, stripped the seal. It needed finesse, not brute force.

She opened the toolbox again, grabbed another gasket (she’d bought two, just in case).

Taking a deep breath, trembling hands, she did it again—slowly, carefully, without raw power.

She re‑threaded, turned the valve on, and water flowed normally. No explosion.

She closed the faucet. No more drips.

Camila stared at the faucet, opened it, closed it, dry now.

She began to laugh—a hysterical, solitary laugh in the soaked kitchen.

— "I fixed it," she declared. "I fixed this shit."

It was never about the faucet. It was about knowing she could survive chaos, get wet, make a mess, and then clean it up—all on her own.

She cleaned the kitchen, dried the floor, took a hot shower.

That night, when she went to get a glass of water before bed, she looked at the faucet with a newfound affection.

She didn’t need a man to stop the leaks in her life. She only needed herself, a YouTube video, and stubbornness.

Two months after Ricardo left, Camila finally found a rhythm.

It wasn’t easy. It wasn’t fast. But it happened.

Monday, Wednesday, Sunday: the kids with her.
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday: the kids with Ricardo.
Friday alternated.

At first it was chaotic. Ricardo was late picking them up, forgot clean uniforms, returned the kids dirty, covered in fast‑food grease. Camila had to compensate, redo, reorganize.

Typical.

But she learned something vital: it was no longer *her* problem.

Fernanda had been clear:

> "He’s the dad. If he doesn’t bring a clean uniform, the school calls *him*. If he doesn’t bathe them, that’s *his* problem. Stop compensating. You’re no longer responsible for his incompetence."

Lawyer Dr. Patrícia reinforced:

> "In the custody agreement, responsibilities are individual for each period. He must learn to manage on his own. You must stop doing his work."

Therapist Dr. Lucas went deeper:

> "Camila, you compensating for his lack doesn’t help anyone. It doesn’t help him grow, it doesn’t give the kids a present father, and it doesn’t free you from the ‘family manager’ role. You need to let go."

So Camila let go—slowly, painfully, but she let go.
