# CHAPTER 6 – The Last Attempt

## Chapter 6 – The Last Attempt

Despite the conversation with Fernanda – and the wilted succulent in the trash – the inertia of an eleven‑year marriage is a powerful force. Stopping a train that’s already moving toward an abyss is hard, even if the train is heading straight into it.

Camila had a relapse of hope.

Or maybe it wasn’t hope. Maybe it was the desperate need to *have absolute certainty*. To be able to tell the judge, the children, God, and herself: "I tried until the very last drop."

There was a week left until Carnival. Ricardo casually suggested:

> "We could travel, right? That farm‑hotel in Atibaia the kids like."

Camila was stunned. He suggesting something?

> "Do you want to go?"

> "Yeah, I need a break. And the kids get less tired there with the monitors."

The goal wasn’t to be together. It was to outsource the children to monitors in a different setting. But Camila grabbed the suggestion like a lifebuoy.

> "We’ll go. I’ll book it."

> "Make sure you get a discount, okay? February is pricey."

She booked. She packed the four suitcases, checked the car, bought road snacks.

**Friday – departure**

The day was hot, that pre‑rain heat that irritates everyone. Ricardo arrived late from work.

> "Damn, traffic is hell. Everything ready?"

> "All set. The suitcases are in the car. The kids already used the bathroom. Just need you to shower."

He showered for twenty minutes. Camila waited at the door, sweating, holding Bia, who was whimpering from sleepiness.

Finally they left.

The trip should have taken ninety minutes. It took four.

The Fernão Dias highway was at a standstill. A sea of red brake lights as far as the eye could see.

In the first thirty minutes Ricardo complained about the Waze.

In the next thirty he complained about the government not fixing the roads.

Then he started complaining about other drivers.

> "Look at that idiot cutting on the right! That's why this country won’t move forward."

> "Ricardo, calm down. The kids are listening."

> "Calm the heck up, Camila. Look at this! We’re not moving!"

The car felt like a pressure cooker. Léo, in the back seat, asked:

> "Dad, are we almost there?"

> "Almost, Leonardo! Almost! If we kept moving it would be faster!"

Léo’s scream startled the boy. He curled up. Camila felt anger bubble.

> "Don’t shout at him, Ricardo. He’s just asking."

Ricardo replied:

> "Ah, now I’m the protective mother. I’m driving this hell, my legs hurt from the clutch, and I can’t even vent?"

> "Vent with me, not with your son of eight."

He turned the radio up. Heavy rock blared, the kind Camila hated.

He knew she hated it. He knew it gave her a headache.

> "Can you lower it a bit?"

> "The car is mine, I’m driving. I need music so I don’t fall asleep."

Camila looked out. Rain began to fall, thick and heavy.

The windshield wipers made a rhythmic *vraaa, vraaa*.

She stared at his jaw, his furrowed brow. She tried to picture a happy moment, the honeymoon, the first trips. Nothing came.

He smelled of cigarettes; he had gone back to smoking “socially”, hidden, but the scent clung to the upholstery.

**Eight‑fifty‑five – arrival at the hotel**

Ricardo woke up. He passed the room where Camila was perched on a chair, attaching balloons, grabbed coffee, drank, went to shower.

He didn’t offer help.

He didn’t ask if she needed anything.

He said nothing.

Camila, balanced on the chair, tape in one hand, balloon in the other, felt that break again: another tiny thread snapping.

**Nine‑thirty**

Léo woke. He went to the pajama room, sleepy eyes, stopped at the decorations. His face lit up, making Camila’s chest tighten with both emotion and exhaustion.

> “Wow, Mom! It looks so cool!”

She got down, hugged him.

> “Happy birthday, my love.”

Léo hugged tightly, the kind of hug that a child gives with his whole body. Camila closed her eyes and, for a moment, forgot the fatigue.

> “Where’s dad?” Léo asked, looking around.

> “He’s taking a shower. He’ll be here to wish you happy birthday soon.”

But Ricardo left the bedroom twenty minutes later, dressed to go out, grabbing the car keys.

> “Good morning, champ!” He ruffled Léo’s hair. “Happy birthday!”

Léo smiled, but it was a tiny smile.

> “Thanks, dad.”

> “Are you staying to help, right?” Camila asked, trying to keep her voice neutral.

Ricardo made a face like he had forgotten something important.

> “Oh, love, I forgot I had that thing with the work crew. Remember I mentioned it?”

He hadn’t mentioned it. Camila was sure of that. But she also knew that denying would spark a fight and she didn’t have energy for a fight now.

> “Ricardo, the party is in a few minutes…"

> "I’ll be back in time! I promise. Three hours, right? I’ll be back before."

He left.

He went out the door, got in the car, and left.

Camila stayed there, in the apartment decorated with superhero balloons, watching her son try to hide the disappointment that his dad had left on his birthday.

> “It’s okay, Mom. I’ll help you.”

Léo was eight years old. Eight. And he was already learning to do what his mother did: compensate for his father’s absence. Camila hated that. She hated that her son already had that forced maturity. The perception that his father wasn’t someone you could count on.

> “You don’t need to help me, love. It’s your birthday. Go play a bit before the friends arrive.”

But Léo stayed. He helped put the snack cups on the table. He helped organize the toys on the still‑empty candy table. And Camila let it happen, because at least he was close to her, and that was better than the alternative.

---

**Two‑forty‑five**

The party was ready. Candy table set – brigadeiro, beijinho, bonbon (which she had fetched at two in the afternoon). Savories warmed and ready. A beautiful three‑tier cake with Captain America’s shield on top. Cold sodas. Tested music. The monitor arrived and was organizing games in the improvised living‑room space.

Camila had taken a quick shower, put on a simple dress, tied her hair. Bia looked beautiful in her new dress. Léo wore his beloved Spider‑Man shirt.

And Ricardo still hadn’t arrived.

**Three hours**

The first guests started arriving. Kids animated, parents polite, complimenting Camila on the décor. She smiled, thanked them, offered coffee, greeted them.

**Three‑fifteen**

More kids. The house was full of excited shouts, laughter, chaos. The monitor ran games. The kids had fun. Léo smiled, but kept looking at the door.

**Three‑thirty**

Camila messaged Ricardo:

> *"Where are you? The party has already started."*

He replied five minutes later:

> *"I’m on my way. 15 minutes."*

**Four hours**

Birthday song time.

Ricardo still hadn’t arrived.

Camila looked at Léo, who was looking at the door for the tenth time. She felt her heart break. She felt anger. She felt a frustration so big it almost didn’t fit inside her.

But she smiled.

> "Shall we sing happy birthday, everyone?"

The kids ran to the table. The parents positioned their phones to film. Dona Marlene, the neighbor, turned off the lights. Camila lit the candles – eight colored candles shaped like the number 8.

And they started singing.

*"Happy birthday to you, on this dear date…"*

Léo was in front of the cake, candles lit, his face illuminated. He looked at his mother. He looked for his father. Camila saw the exact moment her son gave up waiting. She saw a tiny resignation in the eyes of an eight‑year‑old child.

And something inside her died.

*"Many happinesses, many years of life…"*

The kids shouted excitedly. The parents recorded. Bia jumped with joy beside her brother.

*"Happy birthday to you!"*

> "Make a wish, love," Camila said, her voice almost failing.

Léo closed his eyes. He blew out the candles.

Everyone applauded.

And at that moment Ricardo opened the door.

---

He entered, wide‑grinned, with a present in his hand.

> "I’m here! Happy birthday, champ!"

The kids didn’t even look. The parents glanced briefly. Léo looked at his dad and Camila saw… nothing. She didn’t see joy. She didn’t see anger. She saw a kind of tired acceptance that a child shouldn’t have.

Ricardo came to the table, messed up Léo’s hair, handed the present.

> "Sorry for being late, son. Work, you know how it is."

It wasn’t work. Camila knew. She could smell the barbecue on him.

He had gone to some barbecue with friends while his son turned eight.

And worse: he arrived *after* the birthday song.

After the most important moment of the party.

And he didn’t even seem to notice how much that mattered.

Ricardo turned to Camila and whispered:

> "I made it, see? I said I’d be there."

She looked at her husband. She really looked. She saw the smile of someone who thought he had done something right. Of someone who expected thanks for having shown up – late, smelling of barbecue, missing the birthday – at his own son’s party.

And Camila said nothing.

Because if she opened her mouth, she would scream. She would cry. She would throw everything she felt at him. And it wasn’t the time. Not with twenty kids running around the room. Not on Léo’s birthday.

So she swallowed.

Again.

And she cut the cake.

---

The party was a success.

The kids played, ate, had fun. Léo got many presents. Bia ate so much brigadeiro that Camila knew she’d have a stomach wrapped later. The parents praised the party, the décor, the food.

*"You’re so creative, Camila!"*

*"Everything looks beautiful!"*

*"I bet it was a lot of work, but it was worth it, right?"*

It was worth it. Of course. It always was.

But no one asked if she had done it alone. No one asked if she was tired. No one noticed that Ricardo had arrived four hours after the party started.

Or if they noticed, they didn’t say anything.

Because those things we don’t talk about, right?

Six p.m. The last child left. The last mother thanked and left. The door closed.

Silence.

The room was a mess. Deflated balloons on the floor. Plates and plastic cups scattered. The table a wreck. Savories and sweets left to be stored. Chairs out of place.

Camila looked at the scene and felt a fatigue so deep it reached her bones.

Ricardo went straight to the couch.

> "Wow, the party turned out great, huh? The kids had a blast."

*The party turned out great.*

As if the party had organized itself. As if balloons filled themselves. As if savories heated themselves. As if the cake fetched itself.

Camila stood in the middle of the room, looking at her husband comfortably lying on the couch, and had a very clear, very sharp thought:

*I am alone.*

Not alone in the sense of not having anyone physically beside her. But alone in the sense of carrying everything alone. Remembering, planning, executing, cleaning. Alone in the sense that if she didn’t do it, no one would.

Alone in the sense that she was in a marriage, but felt more alone than if she were truly alone.

> "Will you help clean?" she asked. She didn’t believe he would help. But a tiny part of her, stubborn and foolish, still hoped.

> "Later, love. I’m tired," he said, without taking his eyes off the phone.

*I’m tired.*

He was tired. Of what? Of arriving late? Of spending four hours at the barbecue with friends while his wife organized the son’s birthday alone?

Camila looked at Léo, who was in the bedroom playing with his new presents. She looked at Bia, who was lying on the rug, belly full, almost asleep. She looked at Ricardo, glued to his phone.

And she started cleaning.

Alone.

As always.

---

When the kids were already sleeping, the house clean, the savories stored, the balloons thrown away, Camila sat on the couch. Ricardo was still there, watching something on TV.

She breathed deeply.

> "You missed the birthday," she said, quietly.

> "Hm?"

> "The birthday. Léo’s. You missed it."

Ricardo averted his gaze from the TV.

> "Ah, love, but I came, didn’t I? It’s all right."

> "It’s not all right, Ricardo."

Something in her tone made him pay attention. He even lowered the TV volume.

> "What is it?"

Camila felt the words rise. All the words she had swallowed during fifteen days. During eight years of marriage. During all the time she had been the only one carrying the family’s mental load.

> "You forgot your son’s birthday."

> "I didn’t forget. I came!"

> "You came late. You missed the birthday. You went to a barbecue with your friends while I organized the party alone. You didn’t help at all. Not a thing. You didn’t buy a balloon, didn’t fill a snack, didn’t fetch the cake. You just showed up and thought everything was fine because ‘you pay.’"

Ricardo made that face. The face of someone being unfairly attacked.

> "Camila, I work. I pay the bills. You think it’s easy?"

> "And you think organizing a party is easy? You think remembering everything is easy? Do you know how many things I had to do alone in those fifteen days?"

> "You always do such things so well… I don’t understand why you’re complaining."

And there, in that phrase. *You always do such things so well.*

As if being good at carrying everything alone was a reason to keep doing everything alone.

As if she should be grateful for being overburdened.

Camila got up.

> "Do you know what Léo asked me this morning?" she said, voice trembling. > "He asked where dad was. Do you know why he asked that on his birthday? Because he already knew. An eight‑year‑old already knew his dad would miss the birthday. He knew, Ricardo."

> "Ah, stop the drama. He’s fine. He enjoyed the party."

> "He shouldn’t have to approve the party without his dad being present!"

Camila was shouting now. She never shouted.

Ricardo stood up too, irritated.

> "What do you want from me, Camila? I came! I gave a present! I paid for the party! What else do you want?"

Camila realized, with painful clarity.

She would never be able to explain. Because for her to explain, he would have to understand. And for him to understand, he would have to want to understand. And Ricardo didn’t want that.

He wanted her to keep doing everything alone. Because it was easier. Because it had always been that way.

> "Forget it," she said, tired. > "Forget it."

And she went to the bedroom.

She lay on the bed with the day’s clothes still on. She closed her eyes. And she cried in silence.

She cried for the party she organized alone. For the son who waited for his dad and had to swallow disappointment. For herself, who carried everything and no one saw.

And she cried because she realized something terrible:

It wasn’t the first time.

And it probably wouldn’t be the last.

Unless she did something about it.

*End of Chapter 6.*
