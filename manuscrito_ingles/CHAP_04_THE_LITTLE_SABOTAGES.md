# CHAPTER 4
## The Little Sabotages

There is a specific type of madness that afflicts married and exhausted women: the stubborn belief that *more effort* will generate *more love*.

It's the logic of work: if I work more, I will be promoted. If I study more, I will pass the test. So, if I try harder in the marriage, if I am more affectionate, more attentive, creative, he will notice. He will reciprocate.

Camila fell into this trap the following Friday.

The refusal of therapy still hurt, but her traitorous mind rationalized: *He's right in parts. The routine swallowed us. Maybe we just need romance. Lightness.*

She decided to prepare a surprise dinner.

It wasn't a dating anniversary. It wasn't a special date. It was just a rainy Friday when Camila desperately wanted to feel she still had a husband, not just a roommate who snored.

She left work at 4 PM, inventing a dentist excuse for the boss. Ran to the supermarket.

Filled the cart with "Ricardo's favorites."
Filet mignon (the price made her eyes water, but it was worth it).
The bottle of Chilean red wine he liked.
Strawberries for dessert.
Candles.

Arrived home like an efficient hurricane. Bathed the kids, gave them dinner earlier ("today is picnic day on the bedroom rug!", she invented, and they loved it), put on a long cartoon.

At 7:30 PM, the house was transformed.

Low lights. Soft jazz playlist playing (the one they listened to when they were dating). The table set with the good placemats, cloth napkins, crystal glasses that were dusty. The smell of roasted meat and herbs flooded the apartment, masking the eternal smell of lunchboxes and cleaning products.

Camila took a shower. Put on perfume. Let her hair down. Put on a dress she hadn't worn in years, praying it would zip up. It did. It looked great.

She looked at herself in the mirror and saw a beautiful woman. Tired, yes, but beautiful. Hopeful.

*It's going to be nice*, she thought. *He'll arrive, see the table, get surprised. We'll laugh. We'll drink wine. Maybe even lock the bedroom door later...*

Her heart accelerated. A spark of desire—a rare thing—lit up.

7:45 PM. Time for him to arrive.

She went to the kitchen to finish the Madeira sauce. It was perfect. Velvety, shiny.

8:00 PM.
Ricardo hadn't arrived. Traffic, probably. Friday in São Paulo was biblical hell with drizzle.

8:15 PM.
Camila sent a message: *"Are you close, love? I have a surprise."*
Sent a winking emoji. Bold.

8:30 PM.
No reply.
The sauce was thickening too much. She turned off the heat. Lit the candles to test the mood. It looked beautiful. Extinguished them not to waste them.

8:45 PM.
The cell phone vibrated. But it was the school moms' group discussing lice. Camila ignored it.

9:00 PM.
The cell phone vibrated again. Ricardo calling.

Camila answered on the first ring, relieved.
"Hi, love! Where are you? Dinner is almost..."
"Hi, Ca." His voice was loud, with background noise. Laughter. Glass. Male voices. "Listen, forgot to warn you. The guys from the firm got excited for a happy hour here at the little bar on the corner near the office. I'm here with Marcão, Felipe..."

Camila felt the floor open up.

"Happy hour?" she repeated. Her voice came out strange. Hollow. "Now?"

"Yeah, we came to celebrate the month closing. Had a couple already. It's really cool. You don't mind if I arrive later, right? Eat something there with the kids, don't wait for me."

Camila looked at the set table. At the cloth napkins folded in origami shapes (she had seen it on YouTube). At the wine breathing in the decanter. At her own reflection in the dark window glass, dressed and perfumed for no one.

"Ricardo... I made dinner."

"Did you? Well, but it's Friday. We usually order pizza or eat leftovers."

"I made a special dinner. Filet with Madeira sauce. Bought wine. The kids already ate and are in their room. I... I got dressed up."

There was silence on the other end of the line. Then, an impatient sigh.

"Damn, Camila. But you didn't warn me!"

"It was a surprise."

"Surprise you warn that there's going to be one, at least! 'Save the night', I don't know. I don't have a crystal ball. Now I'm here, already ordered another beer, Marcão is telling a story... it looks bad if I run off."

*Looks bad.*
The phrase hit her like a punch.
It looked bad to leave the bar with friends.
It wasn't "bad" to leave the wife waiting at home with lit candles and food getting cold.

"So you're not coming?"

"I am, of course I am. But later. Save the food, we'll heat it up when I arrive. Or eat tomorrow. No need to make a drama, love."

"I'm not making drama." Her voice trembled.

"Yes you are. You have that crying voice. Camila, I work like hell, I deserve a beer. Don't make me feel guilty, come on."

He reversed it. He always reversed it. Suddenly, she was the controlling villain who wanted to prevent the poor worker from having his leisure.

"Okay, Ricardo. Have fun." She said.

"Bye. Kiss. Don't wait up."

He hung up.

Camila stood holding the mute cell phone in the silent kitchen.

Looked at the eighty-reais filet mignon.
Looked at the unlit candles.
Felt like the most ridiculous woman on the planet.

A stupid woman dressed in gala in the empty kitchen.

"Mom?"

She turned around. Leo was at the kitchen door, in pajamas, holding his action figure.

"Wow, mom! You look beautiful! Going to a party?"

Camila swallowed the cry with such force that her throat physically hurt. Forced a smile for her son.

"No, my love. I got dressed up... for us. To be beautiful at home."

"And dad? Isn't he coming to eat? It smells really good."

"Dad... had to work a little more. Meeting."

"Again?" Leo pouted. "He always has a meeting on Friday night."

Even the child knew it was a lie.

"Come here," said Camila. "Are you still hungry? Room for a piece of fancy meat?"

"Room!"

Camila served a plate for her son. Sat at the table with him. Lit a candle just for him to see.

"Look, candlelight dinner!" she joked.

Leo laughed, enchanted.

She watched her son eat the meat that was for her husband. Drank a glass of wine alone. Then another.

Leo ate everything.
"It's really good, mom. Dad is silly to miss this."

*Dad is silly to miss this.*
The wisdom of the innocent.

Camila put Leo in bed later. Kissed his forehead.
"Goodnight, my little prince."
"Goodnight, beautiful mom. You are the most beautiful."

Camila returned to the living room. Cleared the table. Threw the rest of the food into plastic containers without any care.

turned off the lights.

Ricardo arrived at 1:30 AM.
Tripped on the entrance rug. Laughing to himself. Smell of alcohol and cigarettes (he didn't smoke, but the bar must have been full).

Camila was on the sofa, in the dark. Still in her dress.

"Woah!" He got scared seeing her. "What a fright, Camila! What are you doing there in the dark like a ghost?"

"Waiting," she said.

"I said not to wait." He went to her, tried to give a kiss, but she turned her face. He kissed her ear. Was drunk and affectionate. "Hmm, you smell good. Is that the dress I like? Nice cleavage..."

He tried to run his hand over her breast.

Camila felt a violent repulsion. Pushed his hand away.

"Don't touch me."

"What is it? Are you still mad? Because of the little dinner?"

"Little dinner..." She repeated, bitter.

"Tomorrow we'll go out for dinner, okay? I treat. Let's go to that expensive Japanese place. Done. Make up for it?"

He thought it was a transaction. Exchange a rejected homemade filet for an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet and the balance is zeroed. He didn't understand that what she wanted wasn't food. It was consideration. It was priority.

"It doesn't make up for it, Ricardo. It doesn't make up for it. Go to sleep. You stink of bar."

"Ah, what a bad mood. PMS?"

The final card. The classic. If the woman has feelings, it must be hormones.

Ricardo went to the bedroom, grumbling about crazy women.

Camila stayed on the sofa. Took off the dress right there, staying in lingerie in the cold of the living room. Felt exposed. Naked. Foolish.

She swore to herself, there in the dark:
*Never again.*
*Never again will I dress up for someone who prefers drinking warm beer with Marcão.*
*Never again will I cook love for someone who only has hunger for convenience.*

It was her first conscious "little sabotage".
She stopped trying to please.
And when the woman stops trying to please, the marriage starts to show its true rotten foundations.
