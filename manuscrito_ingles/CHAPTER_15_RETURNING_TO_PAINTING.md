# CHAPTER 15 – Returning to Painting

## Chapter 15 – Returning to Painting

Dr. Lucas’s mantra echoed in Camila’s head like a dangerous chant: *do something just for you*.

She had bought the supplies on Thursday afternoon, leaving work early. Walking into the specialty art store felt like stepping into a chapel. The scent of paper, graphite and wood instantly transported her back to her twenties.

Three hundred reais later, she was holding cans of paint, brushes, and a 300 g cotton‑paper pad.

At the register, the card trembled in her hand.

*This is market money. It’s half of Léo’s swimming tuition.*

Guilt shouted, but she swiped the card anyway.

*It’s medicine,* she told herself. *Dr. Lucas said it’s mental‑health care. Medicine is expensive.*

She got home. The kids were with Ricardo. The night was hers.

Camila cleared the dining‑room table, stripped the tablecloth, laid down old newspapers.

She arranged the paints, filled a recycled jam jar with clean water.

She sat down.

The blank white sheet in front of her was terrifying—blindingly white, perfect, too expensive to ruin.

— “Just start,” she whispered to herself.

She grabbed a size‑6 round brush, dipped it in cobalt blue.

Her hand shook.

She brushed the paint onto the paper.

The pigment spread across the damp surface, an azure explosion like a cloud forming.

Camila held her breath. It was beautiful.

She didn’t know what to paint. Flowers? A landscape? The empty apartment?

She let her hand wander.

She made splashes, mixed blue with crimson, watched purple emerge. She dripped clean water and saw tiny bubbles form in the pigment.

She wasn’t painting *something*; she was painting *feeling*.

She painted the faucet‑rage in dark red, bold strokes.

She painted the longing for the kids in pale yellow, soft edges.

She painted loneliness in a cold, bluish‑gray.

As she painted, tears fell.

Not tears of sadness, but of relief—as if she had finally released the pressure valve of a bottle.

For months she had only been *reacting*—reacting to her husband, the kids, work, the divorce, the problems.

Now, brush in hand, she was *acting*—creating. Bringing something new into the world that hadn’t existed five minutes before.

She stayed for three hours, forgetting to eat, forgetting to check her phone.

When she finally stopped, her back ached, the water in the jar turned muddy, and five painted sheets lay drying on the table.

They weren’t masterpieces. They were colorful smudges.

But they were hers. Pieces of her soul she managed to express without words.

Camila looked at her paint‑stained hands—blue on the nails, red on the palm.

She smiled. A tired, genuine smile.

She photographed the mess and sent it to Fernanda with the caption *“I’m back.”*

Fernanda replied instantly:

> *“Holy shit, I’m proud! It’s gorgeous! (What is it? A nebula or a traffic jam? Just kidding, it’s beautiful.)”*

Camila laughed loudly in the empty living room.

She cleaned the brushes with care, washed the jar, stored the paints in a new box as if they were jewels.

She went to bed smelling faintly of gouache (even though watercolor has no scent, her memory invented one).

That night she didn’t dream of bills. She dreamed she was swimming in a sea of cobalt blue, breathing underwater.
