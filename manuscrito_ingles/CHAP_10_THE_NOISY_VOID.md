# CHAPTER 10
## The Noisy Void

The first night without Ricardo at home wasn't silent.

It was noisy.

But it wasn't sound noise. It was *absence* noise.

The refrigerator hummed louder. The elevator sounded like thunder. The wind in the laundry room window sounded like a lament.

Ricardo had left in the afternoon, with two large suitcases and a victim face that would make a Mexican soap opera actor blush. He didn't say goodbye to her. Only gave a quick kiss to the kids, promised the moon and stars ("Daddy is going to take you to Disney", "Daddy is going to buy the new videogame", "Daddy is going to be the coolest guy in the world"), and left slamming the door.

Now it was ten at night.

The children were sleeping. Exhausted from crying, from asking, from trying to understand the new geography of the family.

Camila was in the living room.
Sitting on the sofa.
In "her spot".
She looked at "his spot". The left corner of the L-shaped sofa, where the upholstery already had the shape of his butt from staying there so much.

It was empty.

There was no one scrolling through the Instagram feed. No one complaining about the government. No one asking for beer. No one ignoring her.

Just the void.

Camila got up and went to the kitchen. Opened the fridge.
There were his beers. The expensive craft brand he liked and that cost triple the normal one.

She picked up a bottle. Looked at it.
Felt a sudden urge to throw the bottle at the wall. To see glass and golden liquid exploding on that white porcelain floor she cleaned with such care.

But she didn't throw it. Because the one who would have to clean it later would be her.
Always her.

She put the bottle back. Closed the door.

Went to the bedroom.

The bed seemed like an ocean. King Size. White sheets.
She lay on her side.
Reached out her hand to his side.
Cold.
Smooth.
Empty.

For a moment, panic rose up her throat. *What have I done? My God, what have I done? destroyed my family. Pushed the father of my children away. I'm going to die alone.*

The fear was physical. A tightness in the chest that simulated a heart attack.

She ran to the bathroom. Turned on the shower to the maximum temperature. Entered with clothes and all into the stall. (Didn't even notice she was in flannel pajamas).

Sat on the floor, hugged her knees, and let the hot water hit her back.

Cried.
Screamed.
Howled.

The sound of crying mixed with the noise of the water. There, on the floor of the stall, wet and miserable, she let it all out. The fear. The guilt (ah, the damn maternal guilt). The anger. The longing for what she never had.

She stayed there until the water started to cool.

Got up. Took off the heavy wet clothes. The pajamas stuck to her skin like a second skin of sadness.
Dried herself. Put on an old t-shirt.

Went back to the bedroom.
Lay on the bed again.

And then, it happened.

In the middle of the silence, she heard her own breathing.
*Inhale. Exhale.*
Calm. Rhythmic.

There was no snoring.
There was no tension of waiting for him to arrive drunk.
There was no anxiety of knowing if he was angry or not.

There was just her.

Camila stretched her legs. Occupied the center of the bed. Opened her arms, making an imaginary snow angel on the sheet.

The void was noisy, yes. It screamed loneliness.
But, for the first time in years, the noise was *hers*.

And she could deal with her own noise. What she couldn't stand anymore was his noise silencing her music.

She fell asleep lying across the bed, occupying all the space that, by right, should have always been hers.

Ricardo left home on a Thursday.

It wasn't dramatic. There was no fight, crying, scene. It just... happened.

After two weeks of silent tension—him sleeping on the sofa, her avoiding being in the same room, both pretending normality in front of the kids but dying inside—they finally sat down and talked about logistics.

Coldly. Practically. Civilly.

(it was a lie, but they pretended well)

"I'm going to an aparthotel," Ricardo said. "Until we define everything."

"Okay."

"I want to see the kids."

"Of course. We'll agree on the days."

"I won't pay alimony until the process comes out."

Camila took a deep breath. Controlled the anger.

"We'll talk about that with the lawyers."

She had already been to one. Dr. Patricia Alves. Woman in her early forties, firm but kind. Had explained everything: consensual vs. litigious divorce, shared custody, alimony, division of assets.

There was a long way ahead.

But at least now there was a way.

---

Ricardo packed his bags on a Thursday afternoon.

Two large suitcases. Taking clothes, documents, some personal things. Leaving all the rest.

Leo and Bia watched from the bedroom door.

Bia cried. Leo held his sister but was pale.

"Dad, when are you coming back?" Bia asked.

Ricardo stopped. Looked at his daughter.

"I'm not coming back to live here, princess. But you'll see me always. Weekends, we're going to have a lot of fun."

Empty promise. Camila knew. She knew Ricardo. In the first weeks he would try. He would pick up the kids, do activities. But eventually, he would get tired. Would have other commitments. Would show up less and less.

But she didn't say anything. Let him promise. Because the children needed that hope, even if false.

When Ricardo finished packing, he went to the living room.

Camila was sitting on the sofa. Trying to seem firm. Trying not to crumble.

"That's it then," he said.

"Yeah."

"Are you sure?"

*Are you sure?*

He still asked. As if eleven years of trying weren't answer enough.

"I am."

He nodded. Picked up the bags. Looked at the house one more time. Then at Camila.

For a second, she thought he was going to say something. Something real. Something that acknowledged his share in all this.

But he only said:

"I still think you're going to regret it."

And left.

The door closed.

And Camila stayed there.

In the house.

Alone with the children.

And the silence.

---

The silence was strange.

Camila had always wanted silence. Had always dreamed of a moment of peace, without noise, without demands.

But now that she had it... it was deafening.

The house seemed bigger. Empty. Cold.

Camila walked through the rooms. Looked at the space Ricardo had occupied—wardrobe emptier, bathroom missing his products, remote control abandoned on the sofa.

Signs of absence.

She sat on the sofa. Breathed.

*And now?*

Tears came. Not because she wanted him back. But because it was real. It was final. It was frightening.

Eleven years. Ended. Like that.

Did she do it right?

What if she was throwing away something she could have saved?

What if she was going to regret it?

What if...

"Mom?" Leo appeared at the living room door.

Camila wiped her face quickly.

"Hi, love."

"You are crying."

It was no use lying.

"I am. A little bit."

Leo sat next to her.

"Are you sorry?"

The question of an eight-year-old child who needed to know if his mother was going to give up.

Camila looked at her son. At those eyes that saw too much.

"No," she said, honest. "I'm not sorry for the decision. I'm just sad. Because even when things are right, they can still be hard."

"I'm sad too."

"I know my love."

"But..." Leo hesitated. "You are lighter."

Camila blinked.

"What?"

"You. You are lighter. Not so tired. It's been a long time since I've seen you not so tired."

And there. In that simple observation of a child.

Camila realized: it was true.

She had cried. Was scared. Was sad.

But the weight in her chest—that constant weight of years—was smaller.

Because she didn't have to carry alone something that needed two anymore.

Now she only carried herself and the children.

And that, strangely, was lighter.

"You are very smart, you know that?" She hugged her son.

"I know." He gave a small smile.

And they stayed there, hugged, on the sofa, in the silence of the house.

A silence that still frightened.

But that was beginning, just beginning, to seem a little less empty.

---

First night alone.

Well, alone with the kids. But without Ricardo.

Camila made dinner. Bathed the kids. Put them to sleep.

And then had to go back to the empty room.

The double bed. Which was now only hers.

She lay in the middle. Strange. She always slept on "her side". Now she could sleep anywhere.

She could. But it seemed wrong.

She picked up her cell phone. Three messages from Fernanda:

*"So? Did he leave already?"*

*"How are you?"*

*"Answer me, I'm worried."*

Camila typed:

*"He left. I'm... weird. Scared. But relieved too. It's strange."*

Reply came quickly:

*"Normal. It's a lot of things at the same time. But you're doing well. Day at a time."*

*"Day at a time."*

Camila repeated mentally. Could do that. One day at a time.

She turned off the light. Lay down. Closed her eyes.

And finally.

For the first time in weeks.

Slept.

Deeply.

Without weight.

Without lists.

Without worry if Ricardo had arrived, if he was okay, if he needed something.

Slept because she could.

Because she only needed to take care of herself and the children now.

And that, scary as it was, was also liberating.

---

Friday.

Camila woke up startled.

Looked at the clock: seven o'clock.

SEVEN O'CLOCK.

She had overslept. The kids. School.

She jumped out of bed, ran to their room—

Leo was dressed. Uniform all crooked, but dressed.

Bia was in pants, but without a blouse, playing with a doll.

"I tried to dress her," Leo said. "But she didn't let me."

Camila stood still. Looking at her eight-year-old son who had tried to take on adult responsibility.

And started to cry.

Not of sadness. But of love. Of pride. Of realization that they were going to get through this together.

"Hey, mom, it's okay," Leo came to hug her. "We still have time to get to school."

Camila hugged her son. Tight.

"You are amazing, you know?"

"I know," he smiled.

She dressed Bia. They finished getting ready. Quick breakfast. Lunchbox.

And when she was leaving, Camila realized:

She had done everything alone.

But it wasn't different from before.

Before she also did it alone.

The only difference was that now no one was there making her feel guilty for feeling alone.

---

At work, Fernanda appeared at the cubicle.

"Survived the first night?"

"Survived. Slept even more than normal."

"Welcome to the single life." Fernanda smiled. "You can sleep all night without anyone snoring."

Camila laughed. First genuine laugh in a long time.

"It's weird. Everything is weird. The house seems huge and empty. But... it also seems lighter."

"That's because it is. You took off a weight."

"But I miss him."

"Ricardo?"

Camila thought. Honestly.

"No. I miss the idea of Ricardo. Of what I thought we were. But him? The real person? No."

"That is healthy."

"Is it?"

"Obvious. You don't need to hate him. Just needed to leave. And you left."

Camila breathed.

"I left. God in heaven. I really left."

"You left." Fernanda squeezed her shoulder. "And it's going to be okay."

Camila wanted to believe.

And maybe, just maybe, she was starting to believe.

---

That night, Camila sat on the sofa after putting the kids to sleep.

Looked at the house.

Silent.

Empty.

Hers.

And for the first time in a long time, thought:

*And now, what do I want?*

Not what Ricardo wanted. Not what was expected of her. Not what was "right" to do.

What she, Camila, wanted.

And realized frighteningly: she didn't know.

It had been so long since she had annulled herself that she didn't remember what she wanted anymore.

Who she was.

What she liked.

But she had time now.

Time to find out.

Time to find herself again.

And she would.

Slowly.

One day at a time.

Would find out who Camila was.

The woman who existed beyond mother, wife, employee.

The Camila she had lost eleven years ago.

And it was time to find again.
