# CHAPTER 14
## The New Routine

The house has a cruel way of reminding the divorced woman that she is alone.

It's not the big voids. It's the small maintenance.

A week after Ricardo moved out, the kitchen sink faucet started dripping. *Drip. Drip. Drip.* The sound of hell.

In another life (the married life), Camila would have said: "Ricardo, the sink is dripping". He would have grumbled, stalled for three days, and finally fixed it (or called someone). But it was "his" problem to solve.

Now, it was hers.

Camila looked at the faucet.
Looked at the toolbox Ricardo had left behind (probably because he bought a new, better one for his new life).

"I can handle this," she said aloud to the empty kitchen.

Opened Youtube. *"How to fix dripping faucet easily".*
5-minute video. Seemed simple. Turn off the valve. Unscrew something. Change the "little rubber".

Camila went to the hardware store. The salesman looked at her with that air of "honey, do you know what you're doing?".
"I want a rubber seal for a Deca faucet," she said, firmly, reading the little paper.
He sold it. Cost two reals.

Went back home. Turned off the valve (had to fight with the stuck valve, using a cloth so as not to hurt her hand, cursing three generations of the manufacturer's family).

Unscrewed the faucet. Dirty water came out. Wet her blouse.
"Shit."

But she continued. Changed the rubber. Screwed it back.
Turned on the valve.

The faucet exploded.

It didn't explode like a bomb. But it sprayed water everywhere. On the ceiling. In the cupboards. All over her face.

"FUCK!" she yelled, running to close the valve, slipping in the puddle.

Closed it. Silence returned. The kitchen was flooded. She was soaked. Her hair (recently cut) stuck to her forehead.

Camila sat on the wet floor.

And the urge to cry came. Strong. Overwhelming.
*I can't do this. I'm a fraud. I need a man. I need help.*

She picked up her cell phone to call Ricardo. Her finger hovered over his name.
It would be so easy. "Ricardo, help, I messed up in the kitchen". He would come. Would fix it. And would look at her with that look of condescending superiority: *"See? You can't do it without me."*

Camila looked at the phone.
Looked at the killer faucet.

And, with cold anger, dropped the cell phone on the counter.

"No fucking way," she whispered.

Got up. Dried her face on her wet sleeve.
Opened the video again. Watched attentively. Where had she gone wrong? Ah. Tightened the thread too much, stripped the seal. Had to be with care, not force.

Opened the toolbox again. Took another little rubber (had bought two, just in case).

Breathed deep.
Hands trembling.
Did it all again. Slowly. Carefully. Without brute force.

Screwed it. Turned on the valve. With fear.

Water flowed. Normal. No explosion.
Closed the faucet.
Water stopped.
No drip.

Camila stood looking at the faucet.

Opened. Water.
Closed. Dry.

She started to laugh. A hysterical laugh, alone in the wet kitchen.

"I fixed it," she said. "I fixed this shit."

It wasn't about the faucet. It's never about the faucet.
It was about knowing she could survive the chaos. That she could get wet, make mistakes, make a mess, and then clean and fix it. Alone.

She cleaned the kitchen. Dried the floor. Took a hot shower.

And that night, when she went to drink water in the kitchen before sleeping, she looked at the faucet with unprecedented affection.
She didn't need a man to stop the leaks in her life.
She just needed herself, a Youtube video, and stubbornness.

A lot of stubbornness.
And that, Camila had to spare.

Two months after Ricardo left home, Camila finally caught the rhythm.

It wasn't easy. It wasn't fast. But it happened.

Monday, Wednesday, and Sunday: kids with her.
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday: kids with Ricardo.
Friday alternated.

In the beginning, it was chaotic. Ricardo was late to pick up. Forgot to bring clean uniforms. Returned the kids with dirty clothes, unbathed, full of fast food. Camila had to compensate, redo, reorganize.

Typical.

But she learned something important: it wasn't her problem anymore.

Fernanda had been clear:

*"Ca, he is the father. If he doesn't bring a clean uniform, the school calls HIM. If he doesn't give a bath, it's HIS problem. Stop compensating. You are no longer responsible for his incompetence."*

Dr. Patricia, the lawyer, had reinforced:

*"In the custody agreement, make it clear: responsibilities are individual in the respective periods. He has to learn to manage. And you have to stop doing his job."*

Dr. Lucas, in therapy, had gone deeper:

*"Camila, you compensating for his lack doesn't help anyone. Doesn't help him grow, doesn't help the kids have a truly present father, and doesn't help you detach from the 'family manager' role. You need to let go."*

So Camila let go.

Slowly.

Painfully.

But she let go.

---

First time Ricardo was late to pick up the kids, Camila waited.

Half an hour late. She called.

"Ricardo, are you coming to pick them up or not?"

"Calm down, I'm coming."

"'I'm coming' isn't an exact time. The kids are waiting. Be punctual."

"Have you always been this controlling?"

Camila took a deep breath. She wasn't going to fall for the provocation.

"It's not about control. It's about respect. If you're going to be late, let me know."

And hung up.

He arrived twenty minutes later. Leo and Bia were already tired of waiting.

Next time he was late, Camila did it differently.

He called saying he was running fifteen minutes behind. She said:

"Fine. But after that time, I'm going out with the kids. If you arrive and we're not here, you pick another day."

"You can't do that!"

"I can. And I will. Learn to be punctual."

He arrived on time.

Small victories.

---

There was the time Ricardo returned Leo without school supplies.

It was Sunday night. Monday was an important test day. Leo realized:

"Mom, I forgot my pencil case at dad's apartment!"

Camila picked up her cell phone. Called Ricardo.

"Leo forgot the pencil case there."

"Ah, let him borrow from someone tomorrow."

"Ricardo, it's test day. He needs the materials."

"Camila, I'm not going to drive half an hour to bring a pencil case."

In the past, Camila would have fought. Insisted. Or worse: would have gone out herself to fetch it.

But not this time.

"Fine. Then you call the school tomorrow morning and explain to the teacher why Leo won't have supplies."

"What?"

"He was under your supervision. You forgot to check. You solve it."

"Camila, don't be annoying! Just go get it!"

"No. It's your responsibility. Figure it out."

And hung up.

Ricardo didn't call the school. But showed up at ten at night with the pencil case.

Complaining. Rolling his eyes. Making it seem like Camila was being difficult.

But Leo had the pencil case.

And Ricardo learned: there was no more Camila to clean up his mess.

---

The strangest part of the new routine wasn't the days with the kids.

It was the days without.

Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Camila woke up alone. Empty house. Silent.

In the beginning, it was terrifying.

She didn't know what to do with herself. Walked around the house without purpose. Cleaned things that were already clean. Opened the fridge without hunger. Turned on the TV without watching.

The void was deafening.

Fernanda noticed.

"You need to do something on those days, Ca."

"Like what? I have nothing."

"Then find something. Hobby. Friends. Anything. Stop staying alone in the cave martyrs yourself."

It was Dr. Lucas who helped give direction:

"Camila, you are afraid of the void. And I understand. But void isn't necessarily bad. Void is space. And you can fill that space with whatever you want."

"But I don't know what I want."

"Then experiment. Test things. See what resonates. You have permission not to know yet. But you also have permission to find out."

And that's how Camila started.

---

On the first lonely Tuesday after the conversation with Dr. Lucas, Camila did something she hadn't done in years:

Went to the movies.

Alone.

Chose a movie she wanted to see (not a kids' movie, not an action movie Ricardo would like). A subtitled French drama that was playing.

Bought popcorn. Sat in the dark theater.

And watched.

And it was... strange. Liberating. Lonely. Wonderful.

All at the same time.

Left the cinema and called Fernanda:

"I went to the movies alone."

"And?"

"It was good. Weird, but good."

"Welcome to single life, dear. Enjoy."

---

The following Thursday, she did something else.

Went to a bookstore. Spent two hours just looking at books. Reading back covers. Smelling new paper.

Bought three books. Didn't check the price (okay, checked, but bought even being over budget).

At home, made tea. Sat on the sofa with a blanket.

And read.

For pure pleasure.

Without interruptions. Without a child asking for attention. Without Ricardo complaining about noise.

Just her and the book.

It was magical.

---

On Saturday without the kids, Camila took a bigger step.

Went to cut her hair.

For years she wore the same cut. Long, tied back, practical.

"Mom hair", people called it.

Camila always hated that expression.

As if becoming a mother meant giving up style. Personality. Herself.

She entered the salon. showed a photo to the hairdresser:

"I want it short. Bob at chin length."

"Are you sure? You're going to cut a lot."

"Absolutely sure."

And cut.

Locks falling on the floor. Weight being taken off. Literally and metaphorically.

When the hairdresser finished and turned the chair to the mirror, Camila gasped.

She looked... different.

Lighter. More modern. More... her?

It wasn't the twenty-year-old Camila. It was a new Camila. Older, but also truer.

"I loved it," the hairdresser said. "Looks beautiful on you."

Camila smiled. Genuinely.

And when she left the salon, she stopped at a store window. Looked at herself.

And for the first time in a long time, liked who was looking back.

---

The kids found the hair strange.

"Mom, you cut it!" Bia shouted when she saw.

"I did. Like it?"

"You look pretty!"

Leo stayed quiet. Then said:

"You look different. But in a good way."

Camila hugged her children.

And realized: they were adapting to the new life. In their own way. In their own time.

Bia was clingier, needier. Needed more affection, more validation.

Leo was more serious, more observant. Asked questions. Checked if she was okay.

It wasn't easy. There was still crying. Still "why can't you go back to living together?" from Bia. Still heavy silences from Leo.

But there was also laughter. Hugs. Movie nights with popcorn the three together on the sofa. Honest conversations.

And Camila realized: she was more present.

Because she wasn't distracted by resentment anymore. By anger. By overload.

Now, when she had the children, she really HAD THEM.

Whole. Present. There.

---

One Sunday night—last night before the kids went to their father—Camila put Bia and Leo to sleep.

Stories. Hugs. Goodnight kisses.

When she was leaving Leo's room, he called:

"Mom?"

"Yes, love?"

"You are happier now."

It wasn't a question. It was an observation.

Camila went back. Sat on the edge of the bed.

"Am I?"

"You are. You laugh more. And you don't keep that tired face all the time."

Camila felt tears. But good ones.

"I'm trying to be happier, yes. For me and for you guys."

"I think it was right. You and dad separating."

The sentence caught Camila by surprise. Eight years old. He was eight years old and understanding things many adults didn't understand.

"Why do you think that?"

"Because before you guys pretended. And now you don't pretend anymore. And I think... I think it's better this way. Even being sad sometimes."

Camila hugged her son. Tight.

"You are very wise, do you know that?"

"I know," he gave a small smile.

And Camila left the room with renewed certainty:

She had done right.

It wasn't easy. It wasn't painless.

But it was right.

And little by little, all of them—her, Leo, Bia—were learning to live in this new configuration.

A different family.

Broken in some places. But in the process of healing in others.

And healing, Camila was learning, wasn't linear.

It was two steps forward, one step back.

But it was movement.

And movement was life.

And she was finally living again.
