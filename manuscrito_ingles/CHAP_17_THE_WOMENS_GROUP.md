# CHAPTER 17
## The Women's Group

Watercolor class had become the highlight of Camila's week.
Not only because of the painting (which was improving, the water now obeyed her commands a little more), but because of the people.

There was a peculiar group in that studio room smelling of turpentine and coffee.

**Julia:** 32 years old, advertising executive, wired on 220v. Painted violent and colorful abstract paintings. Spoke loud, laughed loud, and had chaotic energy that Camila adored.

**Beatriz:** 55 years old, recently widowed. Painted flowers with surgical delicacy. Had a sadness in her eyes that Camila recognized, but also infinite sweetness.

**Clara:** 40 years old, single mother of twins. Lived exhausted, arrived late, but painted incredible portraits of her children. Was the personification of resilience.

On a rainy Thursday, Paula, the teacher, suggested:
"Guys, the rain is sad. Let's wrap up half an hour early and go to the bakery on the corner? I'm buying the cheese bread."

The five of them went (Paula, Camila, Julia, Beatriz, and Clara).

They sat at a corner table, with steaming coffees and a basket of cheese bread.

The subject started trivial (paints, brushes, the rain), but soon, as always happens when women sit together with coffee, the conversation deepened.

"So, Camila?" asked Julia. "How's the single life? Has the Husband-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named stopped being a pain?"

Camila laughed. She had told some stories (the one about the jacket, the forgotten birthday).
"Stop he didn't. But I stopped caring. That's the difference."

"Hallelujah!" toasted Julia with her cup. "Indifference is the opposite of love, babe. When you stop feeling angry and start feeling 'whatever', then you are cured."

"I still feel angry," admitted Camila. "Especially when I see him being the 'fun dad' on the weekend while I'm the 'boring routine mom' during the week."

Clara sighed.
"I understand you. The twins' father is like that. Appears every fifteen days, takes them to the mall,stuffs them with candy, and returns the kids wired Sunday night for me to deal with the sugar crash and the tantrums on Monday. It's the classic 'Disney Dad'."

"Disney Dad!" Camila hit the table. "That's exactly it!"

"Girls," said Beatriz, voice soft. "I know it makes you angry. My husband... the late one... he was a good man, but I did everything. Everything. And when he died, everyone said 'poor Alfredo, worked so hard'. Nobody saw my work. It's ungrateful."

"It's invisible," corrected Paula.

They were silent for a second. The rain beat on the window.

"You know what I think?" said Julia, breaking the mood. "That we should form a union. Union of Exhausted Women Who Paint So They Don't Kill Anyone."

Everyone laughed.

"I vote in favor," said Camila.

"But seriously," continued Julia. "You guys are badass. Look at us. Surviving. Creating. Laughing on a rainy Thursday. We are very badass."

Camila looked at those women.
So different. United by nothing but a painting class and the universal experience of being a woman in a world that demands too much.

She felt a wave of warmth in her chest.
Dr. Lucas had told her to find "her tribe".
She thought a tribe was something mystical, hard to find.

But tribe was this.
It was women eating cheese bread, complaining about ex-husbands, and laughing at their own misfortunes.
They were people who validated her pain without trying to fix it.

"A toast to the Union," said Camila, raising her coffee.

"To the Union!" answered the others.

That night, returning home, Camila created a WhatsApp group.
*"The Watercolorists (and the Union)"*
Added the four of them.

The first message was from Beatriz:
*"Thank you, girls. I was feeling very lonely today. You lit up my night."*

Heart. Heart. Heart.

Camila smiled at her cell phone.
She had friends. New friends. Her friends, who didn't know Ricardo, who didn't know "Camila Wife". Knew the Camila of now.
And the Camila of now was starting to like this new group very, very much.
