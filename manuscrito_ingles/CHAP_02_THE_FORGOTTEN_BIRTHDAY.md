# CHAPTER 2
## The Forgotten Birthday

Fifteen days.

Camila looked at the magnetic calendar stuck to the fridge door—one of those pharmacy ads she kept because it was free and, frankly, because it was the only thing in that house that seemed organized.

Fifteen days until Leo's birthday.

Eight years old.

Her firstborn was about to complete eight trips around the sun, and she still hadn't organized absolutely anything. The guilt hit instantly, that familiar punch in the stomach that every mother knows.

Not that she had forgotten. Impossible to forget. Camila thought about it every time her cell phone vibrated with the reminder scheduled months ago. She thought about it every time Leo came back from school excited, talking about Pedro's party (which had a magician) or Sofia's (which had a chocolate fountain). She thought about it every time Bia, with her four years of pure anxiety, asked if "at brother's there will be a superhero cake."

The problem wasn't remembering. Camila's mind was a relentless archive.

The problem was *doing*.
And doing it alone.
Again.

She picked up her cell phone and opened the notepad. Created a new list, typing with the fast thumbs of someone used to managing life on five-inch screens:

**LEO'S BIRTHDAY - 8 YEARS**
1. *Theme (Spider-Man or Avengers? Ask subtly).*
2. *Venue (Home? Building hall? Buffet is too expensive this year?).*
3. *Guest list (School + Family + Neighbors).*
4. *Invitations (Digital is cheaper, but he likes handing them out).*
5. *Cake (The lady from last year raised the price. Research another).*
6. *Savory snacks (Calculate 12 per person? 15?).*
7. *Sweets (Brigadeiros are a must).*
8. *Decoration (See what they have on 25 de Março Street).*
9. *Party favors.*
10. *Soda/Juice/Beer for the adults.*
11. *Gift (He wants the new video game. Impossible right now).*
12. *Entertainment? (Me? Help).*

Camila looked at the list and felt the air get scarce. Twelve items. Twelve categories of problems that would demand time, money, and energy she didn't have.

She looked at the living room. Ricardo was on the sofa, watching a video on YouTube about cars, laughing to himself.

*I'll ask for help*, she thought. *This time it will be different. He's the father. He loves Leo. He'll want to participate.*

Hope is a stubborn thing. Even bruised, it insists on standing up.

---

That night, the "perfect moment" never arrived, so Camila manufactured it.

After the kids were asleep and the dinner dishes (which she made) were washed and put away (by her), Camila sat on the arm of the sofa, slightly invading Ricardo's personal space.

"Love?"

He didn't take his eyes off the cell phone screen. The blue glow illuminated his face, highlighting an expression of mild amusement that vanished as soon as he noticed her serious tone.

"Hm?" he murmured, without pausing the video.

"We need to talk about Leo's birthday. It's two weeks away."

"Ah, that's true. Eight years old, right? The kid is growing up fast."

"Yeah. And we haven't planned anything."

Ricardo finally locked the screen, but didn't put it down. He kept it in his hand, like a quick escape weapon.

"So? What did you think of?"

Camila took a deep breath. Counted to three mentally. *Don't get irritated. Communicate.*

"I haven't decided anything yet, Ricardo. I wanted to decide *with you*. I wanted us to organize it together this year. You know? Split the tasks. It's a lot for me to see alone with work the way it is."

Ricardo looked at her with a confused expression, genuinely perplexed, as if she had suggested they build a rocket on the balcony.

"Love, you know I'm terrible with these party things. Decoration, cake, invitation... that's your thing. You have good taste. You always make everything look amazing."

It was the perfect trap. The compliment that imprisons.

"It's not a question of good taste, Ricardo. It's a question of time. I'm drowning at the office. I need help calling the buffets, or going to buy things if it's at home."

"Okay, but... I don't have time to keep calling buffets, Camila. My boss is on my case this week."

"And mine isn't on mine?"

The silence stretched between them, tense and thin like a violin string about to snap.

Ricardo sighed, that martyr sigh he had perfected over the last few years.

"Okay. Let's do this: fair division of tasks. I pay, you organize. Deal?"

Camila blinked. Felt a metallic taste in her mouth.

"You... pay?"

"Yeah. I fund the party. You choose everything, order it, see what's best for Leo. I swipe the card. Done. Solved."

He spoke with the satisfaction of someone who had just solved a complex equation. Smiled, proud of his generosity.

For Ricardo, "paying" was the letter of manumission. Money bought his exemption from researching prices, from blowing up balloons until dizzy, from cleaning brigadeiro off the rug, from dealing with pre-party tantrums.

He didn't understand that "organizing" wasn't a hobby. It was work. Unpaid, invisible, and exhausting work.

"Ricardo, it's not just money. It's the mental load. It's having to think of everything, remember everything..."

He had already unlocked his phone. The video started playing again.

"Love, relax. You'll ace it. You're the best mom in the world."

*You're the best mom in the world.*

The phrase was supposed to be a caress. It sounded like a sentence.

Camila stood up from the sofa. Her legs seemed heavy.

"Okay," she whispered, defeated. "I'll handle it."

"See? Knew it wasn't a problem." He didn't even look up.

Camila went to the bedroom, sat on the bed in the dark, and opened her computer.

She started searching *"hero party decoration easy to make at home"*.

She would do it alone.
As always.
Because if she didn't, Leo wouldn't have a party. And Leo wasn't to blame for having a father who thought fatherhood was summed up in paying bills.

---

The next fifteen days were a blur of anxiety and rushing during lunch hours.

Camila decided to throw the party in the building's hall. It was cheaper than a buffet and less work than doing it inside the apartment. But "less work" was relative.

She spent her lunch hour downtown, buying disposables at 25 de Março Street, choosing favors, negotiating with the cake lady. At night, after the kids slept and Ricardo snored, she glued labels on candy tubes, rolled napkins, and assembled surprise bags.

Her hands got rough from hot glue and glitter. Her back ached permanently.

Ricardo? Asked twice: "Is everything set for the party?" and "How much was the total for me to transfer?".

He transferred the money. And felt his part was done.

---

The day of the party dawned gray, but hot. Saturday, January 25th.

Camila woke up at 5:30 AM. Couldn't sleep anymore. The mental list was screaming: *pick up cake, fill drinks, take decoration to hall, clean hall (because the janitor never cleaned it right), dress kids...*

She got up, drank a black coffee standing, and started.

At 9:00 AM, she was in the party hall, on top of a wobbly ladder, trying to attach a giant Spider-Man panel to the tiled wall.

Ricardo came down at 9:30 AM, wearing shorts and flip-flops, holding his mug of coffee.

"Woah, already at it?" he commented, looking at the mess of empty balloons and boxes.

"Good morning to you too," said Camila, with a staple in her mouth and masking tape in her hand. "Can you help me fill the balloons? The pump broke and I'm getting dizzy from blowing."

Ricardo made a face.

"Geez, love... I was just going to cut my hair. Scheduled with Gilmar at ten."

Camila climbed down the ladder slowly. Looked at her husband.

"You scheduled a haircut? Today? On the day of your son's party?"

"Well, the party is only at three. Plenty of time. My hair is long, look." He ran his hand over the back of his neck. "I want to look good in the photos."

*Good in the photos.*

The irony was so dense Camila almost choked. He wanted to look good in the photos of the party he didn't help set up.

"Go, Ricardo. Go cut your hair."

"When I get back I'll help, promise!" He smiled, that boyish smile that had once enchanted her and now just tired her.

He left.

Camila remained alone in the vast, echoing hall.

She looked at the 200 deflated balloons in the package.
Sat on the cold floor.
Picked up the first balloon.
Filled her lungs with air.
And blew.

---

One o'clock in the afternoon.

The hall was beautiful. Camila had performed a miracle. The panel was straight. The candy table was impeccable. The balloons formed an arch (crooked, but colorful) at the entrance.

She went up to the apartment sweaty, disheveled, and smelling of latex.

Ricardo hadn't returned.

Leo was in the living room, jumping on the sofa with anxiety.

"Mom! Is the party starting? Is Spider-Man coming?"

"Calm down, dear. Mommy is going to shower, dress you and Bia, and we'll go down."

"Where's dad?" he asked.

"He went... to cut his hair. Must be arriving soon."

Two thirty.

Camila was ready. She had done light makeup to hide the deep circles. Dressed Leo in the new outfit she bought. Dressed Bia as a princess (because she refused to wear anything else).

No sign of Ricardo.

His cell phone went to voicemail.

Three o'clock.

The first guests arrived. They were the punctual parents from school, the ones Camila barely knew but needed to socialize with.

"Wow, it looks beautiful!" praised a mother. "Did you hire a decorator?"

"No, I did it myself," Camila smiled, serving juice.

"No way! What talent! Girl, you should work with this. Where's the hubby?"

"Ah, he... he went to get a last-minute thing. Coming soon."

Lie. The first of many that afternoon.

Three thirty. Four o'clock.

The party was full. Kids screamed, ran, dropped brigadeiro on the floor. The music played loud.

Leo was happy, running with friends, but every five minutes he stopped, ran to the hall door, looked at the empty corridor, and returned with his shoulders a little lower.

Camila saw it.
She saw everything.
And every time Leo looked at the door, her heart broke a little more.

She sent the tenth message to Ricardo:
*"WHERE ARE YOU??? Leo is asking for you. Everyone has arrived."*

Two gray checks. Seen.
No reply.

Four thirty. Cake time.

The buffer (actually, the neighbor she hired to help serve) warned that the cake was melting in the heat. They needed to sing.

Camila gathered the kids. Turned off the lights.

Leo went behind the table. His little face was illuminated by the sparkling candles. He smiled, but his eyes scanned the dark room, searching. Searching for his father.

"Let's go, everyone! Happy Birthday to you..." Camila encouraged, her voice choked.

Everyone sang. *"Happy Birthday to you..."*

Camila sang louder than everyone, clapping hard, trying to fill the void, trying to make enough noise to compensate for his absence.

Leo blew out the candle.
Ricardo wasn't there.

Five minutes later, while Camila cut the cake with hands trembling with rage, the hall door opened.

Ricardo entered.

Hair cut, beard trimmed, smelling of strong perfume—and something else. Beer. And barbecue smoke.

He smiled, opening his arms like a politician on a campaign.

"I'm here! Where's the birthday boy?"

He walked over to Leo, picked the boy up, and spun him in the air.

"Happy birthday, big boy! Daddy's here!"

Leo laughed, hugged his father. Because children forgive. Children want to love.

But Camila... Camila wasn't a child.

Ricardo came to her, gave a kiss on her cheek.

"Sorry for the delay, love. Gilmar took too long on the cut, then I met some friends at the bar across the street, we got talking... ended up losing track of time. But I made it, right?"

He said this with frightening tranquility. *Lost track of time.* As if he had missed a bus, not his eight-year-old son's birthday song.

"You missed the birthday song," said Camila, quietly, so no one would hear.

"Ah, really? Bummer. But is there still cake? I'm starving."

He took a plate of cake from her hand, winked, and left to greet the other parents, acting like the perfect host. The present father. The cool guy.

Camila stood still holding the spatula dirty with frosting.

She looked at her husband laughing with other men near the beer cooler.
Looked at the balloons she filled alone.
Looked at the cake she chose alone.
Looked at the party she paid for with her soul.

And for the first time in eight years, Camila didn't feel sadness.
She felt disgust.

---

At night, the silence in the post-party apartment was sepulchral.

Leo had already crashed in bed, holding a new action figure. Bia slept in the crib, exhausted from so much sugar.

Ricardo was sprawled on the sofa, channel surfing, feet on the coffee table.

"Party was good, right?" he commented, without taking his eyes off the screen. "People praised it a lot. You did well, love."

Camila was in the kitchen, putting leftover cake in the fridge. The sound of the TV seemed too loud for her aching head.

"You left me alone," she said. Her voice came out cold, cutting, echoing on the white tiles.

"What? Oh, love, don't start. I came, didn't I? I stayed there, played with Leo, helped dismantle..."

"You arrived after the birthday song. You were drinking with your friends while I commanded a children's party alone. Leo waited for you at the door for two hours."

"Camila, stop the drama. Leo didn't even care. He was super happy when I arrived."

"He's eight years old, Ricardo! He gets happy with any crumb you throw at him! But he knows. He felt it. And I felt it."

Ricardo sighed and turned off the TV, throwing the remote on the sofa with force.

"I work all week, Camila. I pay the bills in this house. I deserve a Saturday to relax, cut my hair, have a beer. What do you want me to be? A saint?"

"I want you to be a father. And a husband."

"I am! I'm here, aren't I? I'm inside the house with my family on a Saturday night. There are plenty of guys out there who would be out partying."

That was the bar. *Being physically present.* *Not having left.*

Camila realized the argument was useless. He didn't understand the concept of partnership. For him, family was a place you return to when you have nothing better to do on the street.

She closed the fridge door.

"Forget it, Ricardo. Just... forget it."

"Great. Better that way. No fighting."

He picked up his cell phone and opened Instagram.

Camila went to the bedroom.

That night, she dreamed she was on a leaking boat in the middle of the ocean, bailing water with a teaspoon, while Ricardo lay on the deck sunbathing, asking why she was so wet.

She woke up decided to buy a bigger bucket.
But, deep down, she knew what she really needed was another boat.
