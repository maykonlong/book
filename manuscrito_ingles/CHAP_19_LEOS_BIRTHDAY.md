# CHAPTER 19
## Leo's Birthday

Nine years old.
Leo's first post-separation birthday.

Camila wanted to throw a party. Didn't have money for a venue (the divorce was draining everything), so she decided to do it at home.
Old-school party. Carrot cake with chocolate icing. Hand-rolled brigadeiro (with Bia's help). Pulled beef sandwiches.
Invited three friends from school and the cousins.

Ricardo was invited, of course.
"I'll stop by," he said, dryly.

The party was happening. Leo was happy, running with friends around the living room, sweaty, mouth dirty with chocolate.
Camila served soda, cleaned the floor, organized everything. Exhausted, but content.

At seven at night, the doorbell rang.
It was Ricardo.
He came in. Didn't bring cake. Didn't bring brigadeiro. Brought a huge box under his arm.

"HEY CHAMP!" he shouted.

The room stopped. Ricardo always had the gift of commanding all attention.
Leo ran to his father.
"Dad! You came!"

"Of course I came! And I brought your present!"

Ricardo put the box on the floor.
A PlayStation 5.

The uproar was general. Leo's friends shouted "Ooooh!".
Leo widened his eyes.
"Dad! You bought it! You really bought it!"

"The best for my big boy!" Ricardo smiled, triumphant. Looked at Camila. A look of challenge. *See? I'm the man.*

Camila felt a bitter taste in her mouth.
Her present was on the table, wrapped in simple paper.
It was a professional drawing kit and a ticket for them to go together to a comic book exhibition Leo really wanted to see.
Cost R$ 150.00.
The video game cost R$ 4,000.00.

Leo tore open the video game box. Was in ecstasy. Hugged his father.
"You are the best dad in the world!"

The sentence was a stab.
*Best dad in the world.* The dad who didn't go to the school presentation. The dad who didn't wash the jacket. The dad who didn't know the date of the math test.
But the dad who bought the expensive toy.

Ricardo stayed for half an hour. Ate two brigadeiros, took photos with Leo and the video game to post on Instagram (#BigDad #LeosBday), and said goodbye.
"I have an appointment, son. But later we'll install this over at my place, okay? Because here at your mom's it doesn't fit on the TV. (Lie, it fit. But he wanted the leverage of having the video game at his house).

"Ah..." Leo deflated. "It's going to stay at your house?"
"Of course. There I have the 4K TV. Here it's old."
"Okay."

Ricardo left. The hurricane passed.

The party ended. Friends went away.
Camila started cleaning the mess. Heart ached. Felt small. Poor. The boring mom who gives sandwiches while the dad gives technology.

Leo was on the sofa, quiet.
"Mom?"
"Hi, son. Wash your hands to sleep."
"Mom, open your present."

Camila stopped.
"Ah, son. Leave it for tomorrow. Dad's was so cool..."
"No. Open it now. I want to see."

Camila picked up the package. Handed it to him.
Leo opened it carefully (unlike how he tore his father's box).
Saw the drawing kit. Saw the ticket.

He looked at the ticket.
"The heroes exhibition?" His eyes shone. "The one downtown?"

"Yeah. We go Saturday. By subway. And later we can eat pastel."

Leo smiled. A different smile from the euphoric scream of the video game. A warm smile.

"The video game is cool," said Leo. "But I can only play there at dad's. And there he never plays with me. He stays on his cell phone."

Camila stopped sweeping.

"Are we going to the exhibition together?" he asked.
"Together. Me and you. And Bia if she promises not to scribble on anything."

Leo got up and hugged Camila's waist.
"I liked this one better."
"Liar, Leonardo." Camila laughed, crying inside. "The video game is incredible."
"It is. But the video game doesn't come with pastel and with you."

He picked up the drawing kit and went to the bedroom.
"I'm going to sleep, mom. Tomorrow I want to use the pencils."

Camila stayed in the living room.
Looked at the torn wrapping paper on the floor.
Money buys things. Buys noise. Buys momentary euphoria.
But it doesn't buy connection.

Ricardo might have won the night with the check.
But Camila had won the son with presence.
And, in the end, that was what remained when the party was over.
