# CHAPTER 7
## The Last Straw

Camila didn't know, but her body was counting the days. Chronic stress silently corrodes the immune system, until a tiny breach appears.

The breach appeared on a Tuesday post-holiday.

Camila woke up with the sensation of having swallowed barbed wire. Her head weighed a ton. Every joint in her body screamed.

She opened her eyes. The ceiling spun.

She groped the bedside table, knocked over the glass of water, found the thermometer.
Put it under her arm. Waited, shivering under the duvet, even though she was sweating cold.

*Beep-beep-beep.*
39.2°C (102.5°F).

"Oh, my God," she whispered. The voice didn't come out. It was just a painful wheeze.

She looked to the side. Ricardo slept the sleep of the innocent, mouth slightly open, drooling lightly on the pillow.

It was 6:15 AM.
Routine time. Breakfast. Lunchboxes. Uniforms. Backpacks. Take to school. Go to work. Meeting at 9 AM. Project delivery at 2 PM.

Camila tried to sit up. The world tilted violently to the left. Nausea rose. She fell back onto the pillow.

*I can't*, she thought, in panic. *I literally can't get up.*

She reached out and shook Ricardo's shoulder.

"Ricardo..."

He grumbled, pulled the blanket.

"Ricardo, wake up. Please."

He opened one eye. Red with sleep.
"What is it? What time is it?"

"Six fifteen. I'm bad. I have a high fever. Thirty-nine."

"Huh?" He seemed not to process.

"I'm sick. I can't get up. You need to take care of the kids today. Take them to school."

Ricardo rubbed his face. Sighed long and loud.
"Damn it, Camila. Today? I have a meeting early."

The first phrase.
It wasn't "Are you okay?". It wasn't "I'll get some medicine".
It was "I have a meeting".

A tear hot with fever and anger ran down Camila's face.

"I also have a meeting, Ricardo. But I have almost forty degrees of fever. I can't stand up."

"Okay, okay." He sat on the bed, irritated. Threw the covers away. "What hell. Every day it's something. Where is Leo's uniform?"

"On the chair..."

He got up stomping his feet. Slamming closet doors. Making a point of showing he was being martyred.

Camila stayed in bed, listening to the chaos unfold outside.
Ricardo shouting: *"Leo, where are your sneakers? Bia, eat that cereal now! I'm in a hurry!"*
Bia crying: *"I want mommy!"*
Ricardo answering: *"Mommy is sleeping! Stop crying and get dressed!"*

*Sleeping.* He said she was sleeping. Not sick. Sleeping. As if it were a luxury.

Twenty minutes later, Leo opened the bedroom door.
He was already in uniform, backpack on his back, sneakers untied.

He walked to the bed on tiptoes. His little face was scared.

"Mom?" he whispered.

Camila opened her eyes with effort.

"Hi, my love."

"Are you very sick? Dad said you have laziness."

Camila's heart stopped for a second.
*Laziness.*

"Dad... said that?"

"He said. Said you didn't want to get up and it fell on him." Leo touched his small cold hand to her forehead. "Wow, mom! You're burning up! Like the Human Torch!"

"It's fever, son. Mommy is sick. But it will pass."

"I didn't want to go to school. I wanted to care for you. I know how to make cold compresses, grandma taught me."

Camila felt tears gushing. Her eight-year-old son had more empathy in his pinky finger than her husband had in his whole body.

"Go to school, my angel. Daddy takes you. Mommy will be fine."

"Sure?"

"Sure. Love you."

Leo kissed her cheek (ignoring the feverish heat) and left.

Camila heard the living room door slam. Silence descended on the house.
But it didn't bring peace.

She got up.
Leaning on the walls, dragging her feet, dizzy with fever, she went to the kitchen.

She needed to drink water. Needed to take medicine.

The kitchen was a war scene.
Spilled milk on the counter.
Cereal jar open, without lid.
Banana peel on the floor.
Last night's dishes still in the sink (he didn't wash them). Breakfast dishes piled on top.

Ricardo had done the "favor" of taking the kids, but had left the chaos behind. For the "lazy one" to clean when she got up.

Camila looked at that kitchen.
Looked at the puddle of milk dripping onto the clean floor.

And it was there.
The last straw wasn't the fever.
It wasn't the "laziness".
It wasn't the shout.

It was the milk.
That little white trickle dripping from the counter to the floor.
*Drip. Drip. Drip.*

Ricardo knew she hated dirt. Ricardo knew she was sick. And he let the milk spill and didn't pass a cloth. A two-second gesture.

He didn't clean it because he knew *she* would clean it.
Even with fever. Even dying. He knew she wouldn't leave it dirty.

He counted on her exploitation. He banked on her exhaustion.

Camila felt an anger so white, so pure, so hot, that it surpassed the fever.
The dizziness passed.
The body pain was anesthetized by the adrenaline of hatred.

She picked up her cell phone.
Called her mother.

"Mom?"
"Hi, daughter. Your voice sounds strange."
"Mom, I have fever. But it's not that. Can you pick up the kids at school today and keep them to sleep?"
"I can, of course. But what happened?"
"I'm leaving home."

Silence on the other side.

"Today?"
"Now."
"Sick like that?"
"Mom, if I stay here one more day, waiting for him to come back and ask 'what's for dinner?'... I think I'll kill him. Or die myself."

Mrs. Sonia understood. Mothers understand.

"Go, daughter. Take a taxi. Come here. The bed in the guest room is clean. I'll make chicken soup."

Camila hung up.

She didn't pack bags. Didn't have the strength.
Took only the essential. Documents. Notebook. Charger. A change of clothes thrown in the backpack. Toothbrush.

She looked at the apartment.
At the sofa where Ricardo spent his life.
At the kitchen dirty with milk.

She took a paper from Leo's notebook and a pen.
Wrote a note.
Not a long text. Not an explanation. She had already explained a thousand times.

She wrote only three words.
Left it on top of the puddle of dried milk on the counter.

Left.
Slammed the door.
Entered the elevator trembling, sweating, feverish.

The doorman asked:
"Mrs. Camila? Are you okay? You look pale."

She looked at him. Smiled. A weak smile, of a sick person, but genuine.
"I'm not, Mr. José. But I will be. For the first time in a long time, I will be."

Entered the Uber.
Rested her head on the cold glass.
Closed her eyes.

The fever burned. But inside, where it mattered, the fire had finally stopped.

She had saved herself.
Alone.
As always.
But now, forever.
