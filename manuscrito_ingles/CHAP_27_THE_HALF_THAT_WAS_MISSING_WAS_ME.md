# CHAPTER 27
## The Half That Was Missing Was Me

The final exhibition.
"Rebirth".

The gallery was full.
Camila was in the center, wearing a red dress (a color she hadn't worn for years because Ricardo said it was "too flashy").
She was flashy. She was bright.

Her paintings told the story on the wall.
The woman sinking. The woman emerging. The woman flying.

Maria, the journalist, asked:
"Camila, what is the main message of this series?"

Camila looked at the paintings. Looked at the hall.
Saw her mother, with pink hair, laughing with Fernanda.
Saw Leo and Bia running, healthy, loved.
Saw Daniel, talking to someone, but casting a look of pride at her from across the room.

She took a deep breath.

"The message is about wholeness," answered Camila. "We grow up hearing that we need to find the 'other half of the orange'. That we are incomplete until we find a partner."

She paused. The hall fell silent to listen.

"I spent years looking for this half. I tried to fit into other people's halves. I cut myself, diminished myself, silenced myself to fit."
"But the secret... the great secret no one tells... is that we are already born whole."

Camila smiled. A smile that lit up the place.

"The divorce wasn't about losing a husband. It was about finding myself."
"The half that I was missing wasn't a man. It wasn't a status."
"The half that was missing... was me."

Applause.
Not polite. Emotional.
Women in the audience with teary eyes. Fernanda whistling.

Camila looked at Daniel. He winked. He knew. He didn't want to be her half. He wanted to be a whole walking beside another whole.

Later, when the lights went out and the gallery emptied, Camila stayed one last moment alone with her paintings.

She touched the canvas of the painting "Flight".
The dry paint under her fingers.

"We did it," she whispered.

Went out into the starry night of São Paulo.
The air was cold, but she didn't feel it.
She had the fire inside her now.
And this fire would never, never go out.
