# CHAPTER 6 – The Last Attempt

## The Last Attempt

Despite the conversation with Fernanda—and the wilted succulent in the trash—the inertia of an eleven-year marriage is a powerful force. It is hard to stop a moving train, even if it is heading for the abyss.

Camila had a relapse of hope.

Or maybe not hope. Maybe it was just the desperate need to *be absolutely sure*. To be able to tell the judge, the children, God, and herself: "I tried until the last drop."

There was a week left until Carnival. Ricardo suggested, casually:
"We could travel, right? That farm hotel in Atibaia the kids like."

Camila was surprised. Him suggesting something?
"Do you want to go?"
"Yeah, I need to relax. And the kids get less tired there with the monitors."

*Get less tired.* The goal wasn't to be with the family. It was to outsource the children to monitors in a different setting. But Camila grabbed the suggestion like a lifebuoy.

"Let's go. I'll book it."

"See if you can get a discount, okay? February is expensive."

She booked it. She packed the bags (the four bags). She checked the car. She bought snacks for the road.

Friday of departure.

The day was stifling, that pre-rain heat that makes everyone irritable. Ricardo arrived late from work.
"Damn, traffic is hell. Is everything ready?"
"All ready. The bags are in the car. The kids already peed. Just need you to take a shower."

He took a shower. Took twenty minutes. Camila waited at the door, sweating, holding Bia who was whimpering with sleepiness.

Finally, they left.

The trip should have lasted an hour and a half. It lasted four.

Traffic on Fernão Dias was standstill. A sea of red brake lights as far as the eye could see.

In the first thirty minutes, Ricardo complained about Waze.
In the next thirty, he complained about the government not fixing the roads.
Then, he started complaining about other drivers.

"Look at that idiot! Cutting on the right! That's why this country doesn't move forward."
"Ricardo, calm down. The kids are listening."
"Calm down my ass, Camila. Look at this! We're not moving!"

The car was a pressure cooker. Leo, in the back seat, asked:
"Dad, is it far?"
"Yes, Leonardo! It's far! If we walked it would be faster!"

The shout scared the boy. Leo shrank back. Camila felt the anger bubble.

"Don't shout at him, Ricardo. He only asked."

"Ah, right. Now the protective mother. I'm here driving in this hell, with my leg hurting from stepping on the clutch so much, and I can't even vent?"

"Vent to me, not to your eight-year-old son."

"You are annoying, huh? Holy shit."

He turned on the radio. Increased the volume. Heavy rock that he liked and Camila detested.
He knew she detested it.
He knew it gave her a headache.

"Can you turn it down a little?"
"The car is mine, I'm driving. I need music so I don't sleep."

Camila looked outside. The rain began to fall. Thick. Heavy.
The windshield wiper made a rhythmic noise. *Vraaa. Vraaa.*

She looked at her husband's profile. The jaw locked, the forehead furrowed.
She tried to imagine a happy moment. Tried to remember the honeymoon. The first trips.
But she could only smell the cigarette scent coming from his clothes (he had started smoking "socially" again, hidden, but the smell impregnated the upholstery).

They arrived at the hotel at eleven at night.

The children were sleeping, crooked in their car seats.
Ricardo parked in the spot. Turned off the engine.

"We arrived. Thank God. What a hell of a trip."

He opened the door and got out, stretching his back.
Camila got out too. The mountain air was fresh, smelling of wet bush.

Ricardo went to the trunk. Took out his suitcase.
"I'm going to check in and get the key. I'm starving, see if anything is still open."

And started walking towards the reception.

Camila stood by the car.
She looked at the two sleeping children in the back seat. Looked at the other three heavy suitcases in the trunk. Looked at the carry-on backpacks.

"Ricardo?" she called.

He stopped, turned around, impatient.
"What is it?"

"Are you going in?"
"I am, duh. To check in."
"And the suitcases? And the kids?"

He looked at the car as if it were a complex math problem.

"Well, wake them up. Bring the light stuff. I'll send the bellboy to get the suitcases later."

And turned his back.
Continued walking.

Camila stood there, in the fine rain that was falling.
Alone.
With two sleeping children heavy to carry.
With backpacks.
With the responsibility.

She didn't shout. Didn't argue.
Opened the back door. Unbuckled Bia's seatbelt. Picked the girl up—she was heavy, four years of sleeping dead weight.
Shook Leo.
"Son, wake up. We arrived. Grab your backpack."

They walked to the reception. Camila carrying Bia, her own purse, Bia's backpack. Leo dragging his backpack, sleepy.

At the reception, Ricardo already had a glass of wine in his hand (welcome wine), laughing at something with the pretty receptionist.

"Ah, you arrived!" he said, smiling, as if he hadn't abandoned them in the parking lot five minutes ago. "Love, dinner is closed, but they have sandwiches. Ordered a ham and cheese for me. What do you want?"

Camila adjusted Bia in her arms. Her arms trembled with effort.

"I don't want anything," she said. "Just the room key."

"Wow, what a bad mood. The trip was tiring, right?"

Camila took the key from the counter. Didn't look at him.
Went up to the room with the kids.

Bathed them (half asleep). Put on pajamas. Put them in bed.
Ricardo arrived half an hour later, smelling of mustard and wine.

"The room is good, huh?" He threw himself on the king-size bed. "And tomorrow there's feijoada."

He turned on the TV.

Camila was standing near the window, looking at the darkness of the woods outside.

"Ricardo."

"Hm?"

"You left me alone in the parking lot with the kids and the bags."

"Oh, Camila, here it comes. I came to get the key! I sent the bellboy there, didn't I? The bags are already here. What's the problem?"

"The problem is that your first reaction isn't 'how do I help my family'. Your first reaction is 'how do I solve my side'. You took your bag and left. You didn't even look back."

"I was tired! I drove four hours!"

"I'm tired too, Ricardo!"

"But you came sitting reading a magazine! I came stepping on the clutch!"

Camila fell silent.
It wasn't worth it.
His logic was armored by selfishness. His tiredness was senior. Hers, intern.

She lay on the edge of the bed, as far as possible from him.
He tried to put his hand on her leg.
"Let's enjoy? We're at the hotel..."

Camila removed his hand. Dry.
"No."

"Pfff. Okay. Goodnight then, iceberg."

He turned over and slept.
In three minutes, he was snoring.

Camila stayed awake, listening to the crickets outside and his snore inside.
The sound of loneliness is not silence.
The sound of loneliness is the snore of someone who sleeps next to you but lives on another planet.

That was the last attempt.
The hotel was beautiful.
The feijoada must have been great.
But the marriage had been left somewhere on the Fernão Dias, abandoned on the shoulder, under the rain.
