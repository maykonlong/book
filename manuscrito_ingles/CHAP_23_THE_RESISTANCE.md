# CHAPTER 23
## The Resistance

Ricardo showed up on Wednesday night. Without warning.
Normally he only came on weekends.

The doorbell rang at eight. Camila was in pajamas (the old comfortable ones), reading on the sofa after the kids slept.

She looked through the peephole. Ricardo.
Holding something. Flowers?

Camila opened the door, but didn't remove the safety chain.
"Ricardo? Did something happen with the kids?"

"No, no. Everything's fine." He smiled. That "good guy" smile that used to work twelve years ago. "I came to talk to you."

"Now? It's late."
"It's quick. Open up, Ca. Please."

*Ca.* The affectionate nickname. He hadn't used it for months.

Camila hesitated. Then closed the door to remove the chain and opened.
He entered. Brought a bouquet of lilies (her favorite flowers... or were they? No, she liked sunflowers. Lilies were what *his mother* liked).

"For you," extended the flowers.

Camila took them, confused.
"Thank you. What happened?"

Ricardo sat on the sofa without being invited. Looked at the room.
"The house looks nice. Did you change the paintings?"

"They're mine. I painted them."
"Ah, right. The artist phase. They turned out good."

*Artist phase.* Subtle condescension.

"Ricardo, speak up."

He sighed. Looked at her with puppy dog eyes.
"I miss you, Camila."
"The kids? You see them Saturday."
"No. You. Us. Home."

Camila felt her stomach turn. Not of love. Of alarm.

"Ricardo, we've been separated for five months. The divorce comes out next month."
"I know. But... I've been thinking. Did we rush things? Eleven years, Camila. It's a lot of history to throw away."

He got up and came closer to her.
"I know I made mistakes. I was absent. But I changed. That apartment, being alone... made me see the value you have. I swear it will be different."

He tried to take her hand.
Camila stepped back.

She looked at him. At the man she had loved desperately. The man for whom she cried, begged, went to therapy, read self-help books.

And felt nothing.
Neither anger. Nor love. Nor pity.
Just... boredom.

She saw his slightly wrinkled shirt (no one ironed for him).
Saw the haircut a bit overdue.
Saw the neediness in his eyes.

It wasn't longing for her.
It was longing for the comfort she provided.
He didn't want Camila back. He wanted the cook, the housekeeper, the secretary, the substitute mother back. He wanted the infrastructure she maintained.

"You haven't changed, Ricardo," she said, calm.

"I have! I can prove it!"

"Didn't change. You are just uncomfortable. You discovered that single life is work. That you have to wash clothes, clean the house, remember to pay bills. And you want your staff back."

He turned red.
"How unfair! I love you!"

"You don't. You love how I make you feel: cared for, superior, served. That is not love. That is dependence."

"You are very cold, Camila. This therapy is spoiling you."

"The therapy is healing me. From you."

Ricardo stepped back. The good guy mask fell, revealing the usual irritation.
"Fine. If you want it like this. Don't come crying later when I'm with another woman."

Camila laughed.
"Ricardo, I hope you end up with another woman. Truly. Someone has to take care of you, and I am very happy that it is no longer me."

He stood staring at her, shocked by the audacity.
Picked up the car key.
"You will regret it. You will see what it's like to grow old alone."

"I prefer to grow old alone than look die alive by your side. Bye, Ricardo."

He left slamming the door.
The flowers stayed on the coffee table. Lilies. Strong smell of wake.

Camila picked up the bouquet.
Went to the kitchen trash can.
Threw it in the trash.

Returned to the sofa. Picked up her book.
The silence of the house had never been so delicious.

She had passed the test.
The past knocked on the door with flowers and promises.
And she didn't open.

Camila smiled at the page of the book.
She was, definitely, vaccinated.
