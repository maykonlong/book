# CHAPTER 21
## The First Real Smile

The exhibition at the studio.
Saturday night.

Camila was nervous. Had chosen the blue dress (the one she liked, not the one she thought she should wear).

Her three paintings were there.
1. *Drowning* (the woman in the water with the light).
2. *Chaos* (the colorful abstract she made on the day of the faucet rage).
3. *Silence* (a calm landscape, of an empty room with sun entering).

People circulated. Drank cheap wine in plastic cups. Ate peanuts.
But they looked.

Camila stayed in a corner, near the drinks table, trying to be invisible.

An elegant woman, about fifty years old, stopped in front of *Silence*.
Stayed there a while. Tilted her head.
Called Camila (who was wearing the "Exhibitor" tag).

"Is it yours?" asked the woman.
"It is." Camila's voice came out a thread.
"How much is it?"

The world stopped.
Cost?
She had never thought about price.
It was therapy, not product.

"I... don't know. I didn't think about selling."
"I'll pay five hundred reais," said the woman. "It brings me peace... reminds me of my grandmother's house. I want to take that peace to my living room."

Five hundred reais.
Camila did the math quickly. It was the value of the swimming tuition. It was half the condo fee.
But it wasn't about the money.
It was about the value.

Someone saw value in what she created from her pain.

"That works," said Camila, trying not to tremble.

The woman took out her cell phone. Made the PIX instant transfer right there.
Paula came to put a small red adhesive dot next to the painting. *Sold.*

Camila looked at that red dot.
It looked like a diploma. An Olympic medal.

Fernanda arrived late, running over people.
"FRIEND! YOU SOLD A PAINTING!" She shouted, making half the room look.
Camila laughed and hugged her.

Later, Ricardo messaged (he knew from social media, of course, he stalked).
*"Saw you're an 'artist' now. Congratulations. Hope it doesn't get in the way of the kids' routine."*

Camila read the message.
His pettiness dripping from the screen. The attempt to diminish. To remind her that she was "mom" before being anything.

She looked at the red dot on the painting.
Looked at Fernanda laughing with her mouth dirty with wine.
Looked at the PIX receipt in the account.

And then, put the cell phone in her pocket.
Without replying.

She went out to the sidewalk of the studio to get some air.
The night was fresh.
Camila closed her eyes and felt the wind.

And smiled.
Not for someone.
For herself.

It was a smile that came from the womb, went up through the stomach, warmed the chest, and exploded on the face.
A smile of someone who survived the shipwreck and discovered she knew how to swim very well, thank you.

She was divorced.
She was with a tight bank account.
She was tired.
But, holy shit, she was *free*.

And for the first time in years, the future didn't look like a dark tunnel.
It looked like a blank canvas.
And she had just discovered she had plenty of paint.
