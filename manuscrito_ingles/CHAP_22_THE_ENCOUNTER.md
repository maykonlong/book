# CHAPTER 22
## The Encounter

The "Grão" coffee shop in Pinheiros was charming, with rustic wooden tables and the smell of fresh roast.
Daniel arrived five minutes early. When Camila arrived (exactly on time), he was already at a table near the window, reading a book.

He stood up when he saw her. Smiled. His smile was... kind. Without Ricardo's arrogance.

"Hi, Camila."
"Hi, Daniel."

They sat. Ordered coffee.
Camila was stiff as a board. Her hands were cold.

Daniel tried to make conversation.
"So, painted anything new this week?"
"No. Had a lot of work at the office. Month-end closing." Dry answer. Short.

He tried again.
"I understand. I'm also grading final exams. It's a nightmare. Students think teachers love giving bad grades, but actually we suffer together."

It was a joke. Camila should laugh.
But she just thought: *He's going to start complaining about work now. Just like Ricardo.*
"Yeah," she said.

The coffee arrived. Daniel took a sip.
"This place has the best cheese bread in the region. Do you want to order one?"

*He wants to decide what I'm going to eat.*
"No, thanks. I'm fine with just coffee."

The date went on like this for two hundred years (or forty minutes).
Daniel being nice, open, interested.
Camila being a concrete wall, interpreting every sentence of his as a warning sign, a manipulation, or a flaw.

He asked about the children. *Wants to know if I'm a desperate single mother.*
He asked about books. *Wants to test my intellect.*
He complimented her blouse. *Wants to objectify me.*

Camila's mind was a military tribunal judging an innocent civilian.

Finally, Daniel placed his cup on the table. Sighed.
Looked at her with calm, but tired eyes.

"Camila."
"What?" She armed herself. Here came the criticism.

"Can I ask you an honest question?"
"You can."
"Am I bothering you?"

Camila blinked.
"What do you mean?"

"It's just that... it seems like you're hating being here. You are tense, defensive, answering in monosyllables. If I did something wrong or if you didn't want to come, you can say so. We can end it, no hard feelings."

His honesty was a bucket of cold water on the tribunal in her head.
Ricardo would never have noticed. Ricardo would have continued talking about himself, ignoring her discomfort.

Daniel *saw* her discomfort. And respected it.

Camila wilted in the chair. The armor fell.
"Sorry," she said, voice coming out small. "It's not you. It's me."

He laughed lightly.
"The classic 'it's not you, it's me'. But in this case, it seems true."

"It is true. It's just that... " Camila looked at her hands. "It's been a long time since I... went out. And my last relationship was... difficult. I am projecting things onto you that aren't yours."

"Like what?" He asked, curious, without anger.

"Like thinking you're going to criticize me at any moment. Or that you want to control me. Or that you just want to talk about yourself."

Daniel nodded slowly.
"Got it. Ghosts of the past. They are indeed annoying."

"They are unbearable."

They were silent. But a different silence. Lighter.

"Look," said Daniel. "I liked you at the exhibition. I thought you were authentic. But if you are not ready to, I don't know, *meet* someone right now, that's okay. Really."

Camila looked at him. A decent man. Mature.
She wanted to be ready. Wanted very much.
But she wasn't.
Her heart was still under construction. The plaster was fresh. If someone entered now, they would dirty their feet and ruin the floor.

"I don't think I am," she admitted. "I am still learning to be alone. If I start something now, I'll end up using you as a crutch. And you don't deserve to be a crutch."

Daniel smiled. A sad, but beautiful smile.
"Fair. No one deserves to be a crutch. And no one deserves to be a ghost."

He called the waiter. Asked for the check.
"I'll pay for mine," said Camila, quickly.
"Okay. We split."

They left the coffee shop. The afternoon sun hit the sidewalk.

"Thank you for the honesty, Camila," he said. "It's rare nowadays."
"Thank you for the patience, Daniel. And for the coffee."

He went to his car. She went to hers.

Camila got into the car.
The date had been a romantic "failure".
But it had been a personal success.

She had been honest. Had established boundaries. Had recognized she wasn't ready and hadn't forced herself to please a man.

And he had respected it.

*Men who respect exist*, she thought, starting the engine.
That was new and valuable information.

She wasn't going to date Daniel.
But knowing that "Daniels" existed in the world made the future seem much less scary.

Turned on the radio. An upbeat song was playing.
Camila drove home singing.
Alone. And very well accompanied by herself.

Four months after Ricardo left home.

Camila was at the studio exhibition, nervous, sweating cold even with the air conditioning on, trying to look casual while watching people looking at her paintings.

Hers. Camila Ferreira Santos, 34 years old, mother of two, divorcing, survivor.

Artist.

The word was still strange. But it was there. In three watercolors hanging on the white wall of the small gallery in Pinheiros.

"This is very beautiful."

Camila turned.

A man was standing in front of her painting—the one of the person underwater with light coming through. The first one she had truly painted. The most personal one.

"Thank you," she said, without thinking.

He looked at her.

"Are you the artist?"

Camila almost laughed. Artist. As if it were her legitimate title.

"I... yes. I made this."

"It's powerful." He looked back at the painting. "Looks like someone sinking. But there is hope too. In the light."

Camila looked at the man properly for the first time.

Maybe thirty-five years old. Average height. Lightly messy brown hair. Thin-rimmed glasses. Casual sweater. Gentle smile.

"That's exactly it," she said. "Sinking but seeing a way up."

"Personal?"

The question should be invasive. But it wasn't. It was... gentle. Curious without being intrusive.

"Very."

He nodded. Didn't ask more. Respected her space.

"I'm Daniel," he extended his hand.

"Camila."

Firm handshake but not crushing. Warm hand. Eyes that actually looked when speaking.

"Have you been painting for a long time?"

Camila hesitated. Thought about lying. Saying "yes, always". But something about him made her want truth.

"Actually, I stopped for more than ten years. Went back four months ago."

"Really?" He seemed genuinely impressed. "You can't tell. You have a lot of technique."

"Thank you. I'm still... rediscovering."

Why was she sharing this with a stranger?

"Rediscovering is beautiful. The best discoveries are the ones we make the second time. When we understand more."

The words hung in the air.

*The best discoveries are the ones we make the second time.*

"Do you paint too?" Camila asked.

"No. I have zero talent for visual arts. But I appreciate it immensely." He looked at the other paintings on the wall. "And I work with another type of art. Words. Literature. I'm a university professor."

Professor. Literature.

Creative mind. Artist soul.

"That's cool," Camila said, and really meant it.

"Yeah. I love it. Although students sometimes make me question life choices." He laughed. Self-deprecation without being pathetic.

Camila laughed too. Natural ease.

They talked for a few more minutes. About art. About literature. About how cool the exhibition was. Superficial but genuine.

Until Paula called Camila's attention to introduce her to someone.

"It was very nice meeting you, Camila," Daniel said. "Congratulations on the paintings. For real."

"Thank you."

She went to talk to other people. But glanced back at him occasionally.

Daniel spent another half hour at the gallery. Looked at all the paintings. Asked Paula intelligent questions. Drank juice. Eventually left.

And Camila thought that was it.

Casual encounter. Pleasant. Disposable.

Until the end of the night, when she was helping Paula dismantle, she found a little note under her painting:

*"Camila,*

*Loved meeting you and your art. If you want to exchange more ideas about watercolor, literature, or anything, my number: (11) 98765-4321.*

*No pressure. Only if you want.*

*Daniel"*

Camila stood looking at the note.

Heart racing.

Not because it was cute (it was). Not because it was gentle (it was).

But because... how long had it been since someone showed interest?

Real interest?

How long had it been since she allowed herself to be interesting?

Stored the note in her purse. Tried not to think more about it.

But when she got home, alone (kids with Ricardo), she picked up her cell phone.

Saved the number.

Didn't send a message.

But saved it.

And that, for now, was already something.

---

Three days.

It took three days until Camila gathered the courage to send a message.

During those three days:

- Opened his contact 287 times
- Wrote a message, deleted, rewrote more than 40 times
- Called Fernanda in panic twice
- Mentioned in therapy (Dr. Lucas said "And what is the problem with just saying hi?")
- Almost threw the number away 5 times

Until Thursday night, after painting class, glass of wine in hand, she typed:

*"Hi Daniel. Camila here, from the exhibition. Thank you again for the interest in my painting. :)"*

Deleted.

Too formal.

*"Hi! Daniel right? Camila from watercolor. How are you?"*

Deleted.

Too casual.

*"Hi Daniel, Camila. Sorry for the delay in replying. Crazy work. Everything good?"*

Almost deleted but SENT before she could.

Stared at the screen. Message sent. Two checks.

Panic.

And then... three little dots. He was typing.

*"Hi Camila! How good that you wrote! Everything great. How are you? Painting class today?"*

Simple. Easy. Friendly.

She exhaled.

*"Yes I had. Painted a landscape today. First time trying landscape. Came out kind of crooked but ok haha"*

*"I'm sure it turned out beautiful. You have real talent. I saw that night."*

Genuine compliment without trying too hard.

They talked for another half hour. Literature, art, favorite coffees, trivia about the weather.

At the end:

*"Camila, can I ask you something?"*

Camila's heart: PANIC MODE.

*"Sure..."*

*"Would you like to have coffee with me? Like, for real? Without being accidental at an exhibition."*

And there it was.

The invitation.

Date? Friendly coffee? Wasn't clear.

But interest. Definitive.

Camila stared at the message for a long time.

Part of her shouted YES. Part of her shouted RUN.

Thought about Ricardo. About the painful years. About the broken partnerships one after another.

Thought about red flags to look for. About guards to keep up.

But also thought about Daniel's gentle smile. About how he talked to her as an equal. About the note left without expectation, only possibility.

And thought about the most important thing:

She deserved a chance to at least try.

Typed:

*"Coffee sounds good. But go slow, ok? I am... still processing some things."*

Honest. With boundaries. But yes.

*"Totally. At the pace you feel comfortable. Just coffee and conversation. Promise. Saturday afternoon?"*

Another deep breath.

*"Saturday works. 3 PM? Grão Coffee Shop in Pinheiros?"*

*"Perfect. See you Saturday, Camila :)"*

*"See you :)"*

Camila put down the phone.

Stared at the ceiling.

And thought:

"What did I just do?"

But also thought:

"Maybe this is going to be Okay."

Maybe.

And maybe it was a start.
