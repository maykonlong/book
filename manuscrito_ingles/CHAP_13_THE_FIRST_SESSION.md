# CHAPTER 13
## The First Session

The waiting room smelled of bamboo essence and played soft instrumental music, the kind that tries to convince you that the world is a calm place.

Camila knew the world wasn't calm. The world was a place where husbands left, bills arrived, and the chest hurt all the time.

She was sitting in the beige linen armchair, squeezing the strap of her purse until her knuckles turned white. It was her first therapy session.

Fernanda had insisted. *"Ca, divorce isn't cured just with wine and friends. You need a professional. Trust me."*

The door opened.
"Camila?"
A man. Dr. Lucas. Had she chosen a male therapist on purpose? Maybe. Maybe she wanted to prove she could talk to a man who listened.

He had kind eyes and didn't wear a lab coat. Were a dress shirt rolled up to his elbows.
"Come on in."

The room was comfortable. A gray sofa with cushions, an armchair for him, a bookshelf full of psychology and philosophy books. A large window overlooking the treetops of Pinheiros.

"Make yourself at home. Wherever you prefer to sit."

Camila sat on the edge of the sofa. Tense. Ready to flee.

He sat in the armchair. Picked up a pad, but didn't write anything. Just kept looking at her. Waiting.

"It's the first time I'm doing therapy," she said, quickly. "I don't know how it starts."

"It starts where it hurts the most," he said. Simple.

Where did it hurt the most?
Everything hurt.
Pride hurt. Pocket hurt. The longing for the children who weren't with her today hurt.

"My marriage ended." She let it out. "Eleven years. I asked for the divorce."

"And how do you feel about that?"

"Guilty. Relieved. Terrified. And exhausted. Mainly exhausted."

She talked for fifty minutes. Talked about the dead plant (told him about Fernanda). Talked about the spilled milk. Talked about the fever. Talked about the silence in the car on the trip. Talked about the sensation of screaming in a soundproof room.

Dr. Lucas listened. Sometimes asked a short question ("And what did he say?"), sometimes just nodded.
It was strange to be heard. Really heard. Without interruption. Without "ah, but you should have done such thing". Just active listening.

At the end, with five minutes left, he put the pad aside.

"Camila, I'm going to ask you a question. It might seem silly, but I want you to try to answer honestly."
"Okay."
"Who is Camila?"

Camila blinked.
"What do you mean?"
"If you couldn't use the words 'mother', 'wife' (or ex-wife) and 'financial analyst'... who are you?"

Camila opened her mouth to answer. Closed it.
*Who am I?*
Without the kids? Without Ricardo? Without the company badge?

"I... I don't know," she whispered. Panic returned. "I don't know. I'm Leo and Bia's mother. I organize the house. I take care of things."

"That is what you *do*. I asked who you *are*. What do you like? What makes you laugh? What moves you? What is your favorite color other than the one that shows less dirt?"

Camila started to cry.
Silent, hot tears.

"I don't know," she sobbed. "I forgot. I lost Camila somewhere between diapers and bills. I don't remember her."

Dr. Lucas held out a box of tissues. She took one, blew her nose with zero elegance.

"That is normal, Camila. It's what we call fusion. You fused with the roles you played. And now that one of those roles (the wife) ended, you feel like you disappeared."

"Will I find her again?"

"You will. She's there. She's buried under a lot of 'obligation' and 'duty', but she's there."

He looked at his watch.

"Our session is over. But I'm going to leave you homework."
"Homework?"
"Yes. For next week. I want you to make a list of three things. Just three. Things that 20-year-old Camila liked doing and that today's Camila doesn't do anymore. And I want you to try to do one of them."

"Just that?"
"Just that. Rediscovering who you were before being 'someone's'."

Camila left the office with swollen eyes and smeared mascara, but with a strange sensation in her chest.
A seed.

She got into the car. Picked up a parking ticket and a Bic pen lost in the glove compartment.

*Three things.*

closed her eyes and tried to remember.
Who was she at 20? Before Ricardo? Before the bills?

The memory came like a flash of light.

1. *Painting watercolor.* (She loved painting. Where were the brushes?)
2. *Reading poetry aloud.* (She had dusty Neruda and Leminski books on the shelf).
3. *Drinking cheap wine listening to jazz and dancing alone in the living room.*

Camila looked at the list.
They were such simple things. So silly.
But they seemed forbidden.

She put the paper in her wallet.

*I'll try*, she thought. *For the Camila I forgot.*

She started the car and drove back to the noisy void of her house, but now with a small, tiny, secret mission in her pocket.
