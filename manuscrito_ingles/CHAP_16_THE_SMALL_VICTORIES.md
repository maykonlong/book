# CHAPTER 16
## The Small Victories

Three months after Ricardo left, Camila started collecting small victories.
They weren't movie victories, with triumphant music and fireworks. They were silent victories, invisible to the world, but monumental to her.

**Victory 1: The "No"**

It was Sunday night. Ricardo had just picked up the kids (finally punctual, after three fights). He stopped at the door, with that face of someone who is going to ask for a "small" favor.

"Ca, can you wash this jacket of Leo's? He got ice cream on it and I don't have a machine at the hotel."
Sneaky. He knew Camila wouldn't let her son wear dirty clothes.

In another life, Camila would have taken the jacket. Would have washed. Ironed. And returned it smelling good.

But today's Camila looked at the jacket in his hand.

"No," she said. Dry.

Ricardo blinked, confused, as if she had spoken in Aramaic.
"What do you mean no? It's for Leo."

"Exactly. He was with you. It's your responsibility. If you don't have a machine, wash it in the sink. Or take it to the laundromat."

"Wow, Camila. How much ill will. Does it cost to wash a jacket?"

It cost. It cost her dignity. Cost returning to the role of "husband's mother".

"It costs. It costs my rest time. Good night, Ricardo."

And closed the door in his face.
Leaned against the closed door, heart beating a mile a minute. Hands trembling.
But she smiled. A Mexican soap opera villain smile.
*Let him wash the damn jacket.*

**Victory 2: The Bar with Fernanda**

Friday night. No kids.
Fernanda dragged her to a bar in Pinheiros.
"Let's celebrate."
"Celebrate what?" asked Camila, feeling out of place in that sea of young, single people.
"Celebrate that you're not at home crying watching romantic comedy."

They ordered gin and tonics.
Camila was tense. *What do I talk about? Do I only know how to talk about diapers and divorce? I'm going to be the bore of the table.*

But then, an old song played (2000s, their era). And Fernanda started telling an absurd story about a Tinder date that went wrong (the guy took his mother on the date).

Camila laughed.
Not that polite office laugh. Laughed loud. Laughed until her belly hurt. Laughed until tears came out.

For two hours, she didn't think about Leo, about Bia, about Ricardo, about bills.
She was just Camila. The woman who liked gin, who knew the lyrics to all Shakira songs and who had a scandalous laugh.

When she returned home (by Uber, slightly tipsy), she looked at the city passing by the window.
São Paulo was illuminated. Beautiful.
And she was part of the city again. Was no longer locked in an ivory tower of resentment.

**Victory 3: The Old Pajamas**

Sunday morning. Alone.
Camila woke up at ten.
Made coffee.
And stayed in pajamas all day.

The day. The whole day.

Without a shower. Without changing clothes. Without making the bed.
Watched six episodes of some series. Read a book. Ate popcorn for lunch.

Ricardo hated when she stayed in pajamas. *"Looks like sloppiness, Camila. Get dressed."*
He thought the wife had to be always presentable, even inside the house on Sunday.

But Ricardo wasn't there.

Camila looked at the hallway mirror. Messy hair, holey Mickey t-shirt, baggy sweatpants.
"You look beautiful," she said to the reflection.

And she really was.
Because she was free.

These victories didn't go to Instagram. Nobody liked "I washed my own dishes on Monday instead of Sunday".
But they were the bricks of the new emotional house she was building.
And this house, this time, would have unshakable foundations.

Three months after Ricardo left, Camila started noticing the small victories.

They weren't big. Weren't dramatic. Weren't the type you celebrate with a party or champagne.

But they were real.

And important.

---

The first small victory was a Tuesday morning.

Camila woke up. Looked at the clock: seven in the morning.

Just seven.

And she had woken up naturally. Without an alarm screaming. Without a child jumping on the bed. Without Ricardo snoring on the side.

Just... peace.

She stayed lying down for a few minutes. Just existing. Without urgency. Without a mental list starting to run automatically.

Heard birds through the window. Felt the sun entering through the curtain crack.

Stretched her arms.

And smiled.

Small smile. Peaceful.

Because she could. Because it was Tuesday. Kids with dad. Free day ahead.

Got up at her own pace. Made coffee—strong, the way she liked. Sat near the window with the cup and a book.

And read.

For an hour.

Without interruptions. Without guilt. Without a voice in her head saying she should be doing something "productive".

Just... relaxed.

And when she put the book aside and went to shower, Camila realized:

This was a small victory.

Waking up without weight. Starting the day at her own pace. Doing things just for her.

Things that seemed silly. But six months ago were impossible.

---

The second small victory was at the market.

Saturday. Shopping day. Kids with her.

Camila shopped with a list. Always. Because wandering in the market with two small children was a recipe for disaster and budget blowout.

But this time...

She was passing through the book and magazine aisle when something caught her attention: an art magazine. Watercolor. With landscape tutorials.

Camila picked it up. Leafed through.

Beautiful. Interesting. Expensive.

R$ 35.

Before, she would have put it back. Because "don't need it". Because "it's waste". Because "there are more important things".

But this time, she looked at the magazine. Thought about the Thursdays at the studio. About the joy painting was bringing back.

And put it in the cart.

Without guilt.

Well, with a little bit of guilt. But did it anyway.

Bia saw.

"Mom, play are you going to buy a magazine?"

"I am. It's painting."

"Do you paint?"

The question caught Camila by surprise. Bia was four years old. Didn't remember mom painting. Because Camila had stopped before she was born.

"I'm going back to painting. I take a class every Thursday."

"Really?" Leo looked. "That's cool."

"Is it cool?"

"It is. You should do things you like, mom."

Eight years old. Giving permission for mom to be a person.

Camila hugged her children there, in the middle of the market aisle.

And bought the magazine.

---

The third small victory was saying no.

It was Sunday night. Camila had just picked up the kids at Ricardo's house when he asked:

"Ah, Camila, can you wash those pants of Leo's? They are dirty but I forgot to wash them."

Before, Camila would have said: "Okay, no problem."

Before, she would have washed. Ironed. Returned when it was his next period.

But not this time.

"No."

Ricardo blinked.

"What?"

"No. They were with you. You wash them."

"But I don't have a washing machine here at the aparthotel."

"Then take them to a laundry. Or wash by hand. I don't know. But it's not my responsibility."

"Camila, stop being childish. It's just pants."

"Exactly. Just pants. That YOU can wash."

She put the kids' backpacks in the car. Ignored Ricardo trying to argue. Got in. Drove away.

On the way home, felt adrenaline. Confrontation still made her nervous.

But also felt... triumph?

She had said no. And hadn't explained too much. Hadn't justified herself. Hadn't yielded.

Just: no.

Firm. Clear. Final.

Small victory.

---

The fourth small victory was in therapy.

Fourth session. Camila was already getting used to Dr. Lucas. Starting to trust.

He asked:

"How are you feeling this week?"

And Camila answered without thinking:

"Light."

Dr. Lucas raised his eyebrows.

"Light?"

"Yeah. I know there are still a thousand things. The divorce isn't over yet. There's lawsuit. There's tight money. There's child sometimes crying. But... I feel light. As if a giant weight had come off."

"And do you feel guilty for feeling light?"

Camila thought. Honestly.

"A little. But much less than before."

"That is progress."

"Is it?"

"A lot. You are integrating. Accepting that difficult decisions can bring relief. That it is not betrayal of the marriage, the children, or yourself, to feel better."

Camila took a deep breath.

"I think... I think I'm starting to forgive myself."

Dr. Lucas smiled.

"That, Camila, is not a small victory. It is huge."

And it was.

---

The fifth small victory—the most significant—happened on a Thursday night.

Watercolor class. Fourth week.

Paula had proposed: paint something personal. Something that means something to you.

Camila stood still in front of the blank paper.

What meant something?

Thought about the children. But didn't want to paint the obvious.

Thought about the sea. Always loved the sea.

But then... something clicked.

She wetted the brush. Picked up blue. Started.

Didn't plan. Just... felt.

Deep blue. Then light blue. A little white. Movement.

Water. Waves.

But not sea. Something more... internal?

She added yellow. Golden. Rays of sun coming through.

And as she painted, realized what it was:

It was her. Underwater. Sinking.

But the sun rays arriving. Illuminating. Showing the way to the surface.

When she finished, she stepped back. Looked.

It wasn't technically perfect. The proportions were kind of weird. The perspective wasn't realistic.

But it was... true.

It was light opening a path through the darkness.

It was hope.

Paula came to see.

"Wow. Camila, this is beautiful."

"Really?"

"Very. It has emotion. You can feel what you were feeling when you painted."

And Camila realized: it was true.

She had put something of herself on paper. Something real. Vulnerable.

Something no one could take away.

At the end of class, Paula asked:

"Does anyone want to share?"

Camila, surprisingly, raised her hand.

"I'll share."

Showed the group.

And told. Briefly. About the difficult moment she was going through. About feeling she was sinking. But also about light starting to appear.

The other people in the group nodded. An older woman said:

"I understand. I went through something similar."

Another: "It's beautiful. For real."

And Camila realized: she had opened up. To strangers. About something painful.

And hadn't been destroyed. Had been welcomed.

That was victory. Huge.

---

That night, Camila hung the painting on the fridge door.

Not the kids' space. But hers.

When Leo saw it the next day, he asked:

"Did you make this, mom?"

"I did."

"It's very pretty. You are good."

"I'm still learning. But thank you."

"Looks like someone is underwater but seeing light."

Camila looked at her son. Always perceptive.

"That's exactly it."

"Like you?"

"Like me."

Leo nodded. Didn't say anything more. But Camila saw in his little eyes: understanding. Childish but real support.

---

Sunday night, after putting the kids to sleep, Camila sat on the sofa with a notebook.

Was doing this recently: listing. Not tasks. Not obligations.

But victories.

Small victories of the week.

She wrote:

**VICTORIES OF THE WEEK:**
- Woke up without weight (Tuesday)
- Bought magazine for myself without excessive guilt (Saturday)
- Said no to Ricardo (Sunday)
- Admitted in therapy that I am forgiving myself (Wednesday)
- Painted something personal and shared (Thursday)
- Leo said I am good at painting (Friday)

Six things. In one week.

Six moments where she was more herself. More whole. More free.

Six months ago, a list like this was unimaginable.

Six months ago, she was drowned. Invisible. Exhausted.

Now...

Now she was emerging.

Slowly. Uncertainly. Scarily.

But emerging.

And these small victories—fragile, delicate, precious—were evidence.

That it was possible.

That she was managing.

That she was going to be okay.

Not today. Not tomorrow.

But eventually.

Camila closed the notebook. Looked at the painting on the fridge. At the silent but no longer so empty house.

And felt something rare:

Gratitude.

Not for the pain. Not for the separation.

But for having had courage.

Courage to leave. To choose. To try.

And for each small victory that proved:

She had done right.
