# CHAPTER 18
## Maternal Guilt

Leo had a presentation at school. "My Family" - History project. Thursday, two in the afternoon.
Camila had asked to leave work early two weeks in advance.

And Ricardo?
Ricardo had said: "I'll try."

*Try.* The favorite verb of absent fathers.

Camila arrived at school at 1:45 PM. The auditorium smelled of furniture polish and childhood anxiety.
She sat in the third row. Saved the seat next to her with her purse.

Sent a message: *"I'm already here. Third row."*
Seen. No reply.

The presentations began.
Children went up on stage with colorful posters. Some spoke well, others stuttered. Parents took photos, filmed, waved.

At 2:10 PM, they called Leonardo.

Camila looked at the door. Nothing.
The seat beside her remained empty.

Leo went up on stage. He looked beautiful in the polo shirt she had ironed that morning.
He looked at the audience. His eyes scanned the chairs. Found Camila. He smiled.
But then his eyes continued searching. Went to her side. Saw the empty chair.

The smile withered.

It was a fraction of a second. But for a mother, it lasted an eternity. The exact moment a child's heart breaks a little bit.

Leo held the poster.
"My family..." His voice cracked. He coughed. "My family is now in two houses."

He showed the drawing. On one side, a building (mom's). On the other, a hotel (dad's). In the middle, him and Bia.

"I live with my mom and see my dad on weekends. My mom takes care of us and works. My dad works a lot too."

"Works a lot". The excuse children learn to give to justify parental absence.

Camila filmed with a trembling hand. Wanted to go up there, hug her son, and scream. But she stayed quiet. Smiling. Waving. Being the rock he needed to see.

When it was over, Leo came down. Camila hugged him tight.
"You were incredible, son! Incredible!"
"Dad didn't come," he said. It wasn't a question.
"He had an emergency at work, love. He really wanted to come." (Lie. Who wants to, comes. But we lie to protect.)

"Okay," said Leo. Dry. Too adult.

In the car, heading home, guilt hit Camila like a truck.
*It's my fault. If I hadn't separated, Ricardo would be there. Or at least would be at home waiting. Now my son has to present a project about 'two houses' and be embarrassed.*

She cried in the shower, hidden.
Maternal guilt needs no facts. It feeds on "what ifs".
*What if I had endured a little longer?*
*What if I'm selfish for wanting to be happy at the expense of their stability?*

But then, at night, Leo came to the living room where she was sitting in the dark.
"Mom?"
"Hi, son."
"Thanks for going."
"Of course I went. I always go."
"I know. You're always there."

He kissed her on the cheek and went to sleep.
Camila stayed there, in the dark.
"You're always there".

Maybe the guilt was wrong.
Maybe what mattered wasn't the perfect family on the poster.
But who was in the third row, clapping, rain or shine.
And that person was her.

Leo had a presentation at school.

"My Family" - History project about family structures over time. Each child would present their own family. Thursday, two in the afternoon.

Camila had asked to leave work early. Confirmed two weeks in advance.

And Ricardo... Ricardo had promised to try.

*Try.*

The word that meant "probably not, but I don't want to fight right now".

---

Thursday arrived.

Camila left the office at noon. Ate lunch quickly. Arrived at the school at one forty-five—fifteen minutes before the presentation started.

Small auditorium filling with parents. Mothers, mostly. Some fathers. Few grandparents.

Camila found a seat. Reserved the seat next to her for Ricardo.

Sent a message:

*"I've arrived. Saved a seat for you."*

Reply took a while. Then:

*"Leaving now. Be there soon."*

Leaving now meant: going to be late.

Camila took a deep breath. Controlled the irritation. At least he was coming.

Presentations began.

A girl spoke about her large family - six siblings, all living in the same house with grandparents.

A boy about divorced parents who got along well - harmonious shared custody.

A girl about two mothers.

And Ricardo didn't arrive.

Camila looked at the door every minute. Cell phone on silent but vibrating occasionally - work, probably. She ignored it.

When they called Leo, the seat next to her was still empty.

---

Leo went up on the makeshift little stage. Large poster in hands. Nervous but trying to seem confident.

Camila saw the exact moment he looked for his father in the audience.

Eyes scanning rows. Searching. Hopeful.

Then... acceptance. Silent resignation of a child who already expected disappointment.

And Camila felt her heart break.

Leo started presenting:

"My family is... different now." Voice small but firm. "Before it was me, my sister Bia, my mom, and my dad. We lived all together."

He turned the poster. Drawing of the family. Four stick figures holding hands. House behind. Yellow sun in the corner.

"But now my parents are separated. So it's like this."

Turned it again. New drawing. Him and Bia in the center. Camila on one side. Ricardo on the other - further away, in a separate corner.

The teacher smiled encouragingly. The room was in respectful silence.

"I live with my mom during the week. And with my dad some weekends." Pause. "My mom always comes to presentations. My dad... comes when he can."

The sentence fell heavy.

*Comes when he can.*

Eight-year-old child translation for: doesn't come.

Camila held back tears. Crowded room. Couldn't fall apart.

Leo continued, quieter:

"But it's okay. Because even separated, they are still my parents. And I... I still have a family. It's just different now."

Finished. Audience applauded gently.

Leo came down looking at his feet.

And Camila saw: shame. Disguised sadness.

Because dad hadn't come. Again.

---

End of presentations. Parents picking up children. Praises. Photos.

Camila found Leo in the hallway. He tried to smile but failed.

"You were great, love. Very great."

"Thanks."

"Your father..."

"It's okay, mom." He interrupted. "I knew he wasn't going to make it."

*I knew.*

As if he had already learned not to expect. As if expectation only caused disappointment so better not to have it.

Eight years old. And already had this forced maturity. This emotional protection.

Camila knelt in front of him:

"Leo, look at me. Your father loves you. A lot. He just... has difficulty showing it. Prioritizing right."

"I know."

"You don't deserve to be a second option, okay? You deserve a father who shows up. Always."

Leo hugged her. Tight. Hiding his face in her shoulder.

And Camila realized horrified: he was protecting HER. Not letting her see he was hurt so as not to hurt her too.

---

In the car, heavy silence.

Bia chattered about her day at daycare. Leo looked out the window.

Camila gripped the steering wheel with force. Anger growing.

When they arrived home, she put cartoons on for the kids. Picked up her cell phone. Went to the bedroom.

Called Ricardo.

He answered on the third ring:

"Hi."

"You didn't go." It wasn't a question. It was a controlled accusation.

"Camila, sorry. Had an emergency meeting at work. I told you I would try..."

"TRYING IS NOT ENOUGH!" She exploded. "You are a FATHER, Ricardo! Your son had an important presentation. He made a poster about OUR family. And you didn't show up!"

"Don't yell at me. I work. Unlike you, I can't leave whenever I want."

"I work TOO! And yet I left! Because I prioritize my children!"

"Our children are fine. Stop the drama."

*Drama.*

There was the word again. Automatic invalidation.

"You hurt your son today, Ricardo. He looked for you in the audience. And you weren't there. AGAIN."

"Camila, I'll make it up to him. I'll take him to the mall on the weekend..."

"He doesn't want the mall! He wants a FATHER! Present! Who shows up! Who gives importance!"

Silence on the other side.

Then:

"Look, I don't know what you want me to do. I do what's possible."

"No. You do what's convenient. And your possible isn't enough."

"If you think I'm such a bad father, maybe you should have stayed for full custody."

The sentence was a slap.

"Is it about that? About custody? Not about BEING A FATHER for real?"

"Don't bother me, Camila. I'm tired."

And hung up.

HUNG UP.

Camila stood looking at the screen. Call ended.

And started to cry.

Of anger. Of frustration. Of guilt.

Massive, crushing guilt.

Because she was the one who had done this. She was the one who had separated. She was the one who had "broken the family".

And now Leo suffered consequences.

---

That night, bedtime, Leo called her in the room:

"Mom?"

"Yes, love?"

He was lying down, looking at the ceiling.

"Are you guys going to get back together? You and dad?"

Camila felt the air leave her lungs. The question had to come eventually. But it still hurt.

"No, love. We aren't getting back together."

Leo processed. Then:

"I wished it was different."

"I wished too, baby. I wished too." She sat on the edge of the bed. "But sometimes things don't work. Even when we want them to very much. And then we have to choose: pretend everything is okay or have the courage to change."

"And you chose to change."

"I chose."

Tears running down his little face.

"Was it my fault? Yours and dad's?"

"NO." Camila pulled him into a fierce hug. "It was NEVER your fault. Neither yours nor Bia's. It was between me and your father. Adults. Nothing you did or didn't do."

"But if we were better..."

"Leo, look at me." She held his little face. "You and your sister are PERFECT. The separation was because your father and I didn't know how to be happy together anymore. Not because you did something wrong. Never."

He cried. Finally. Stored cry. Cry of months.

And Camila cried along.

Because there was no right answer. No way to make it not hurt.

There was only love. And truth. And presence.

When he finally slept, exhausted, Camila left the room and called Dr. Patricia - no, wrong. Called Dr. Lucas.

Answered second ring:

"Camila? Everything okay?"

"I destroyed my children." Voice broken.

"Where are you? Are you safe?"

"At home. Kids sleeping. But Dr. Lucas, I did everything wrong. Leo presented today at school and Ricardo didn't go and he cried and asked if they are getting back together and..."

"Breathe. Slowly. You are in crisis now. Let's process together. Can we?"

"We can."

Half an hour of conversation. Dr. Lucas patient, gentle, firm.

Deconstructing guilt. Differentiating her responsibility from Ricardo's responsibility.

"You can't control his actions, Camila. Only can control yours."

"But the kids suffer."

"Yes. And that hurts. But they don't suffer because you chose to leave. They suffer because the father chooses not to show up. Don't confuse the two things."

"How do I not confuse? I started this!"

"You ended something unsustainable. Ricardo is the one who chooses not to be a present father. That is his. Not you."

"But perfect mother..."

"Doesn't exist." Firm. "Perfect mother is a lie, Camila. Present, honest mother, who cares - that exists. And you ARE that. You were at the presentation. You held Leo when he cried. You are here, calling, processing, wanting to do right. That is being a good mother."

"But I feel so guilty..."

"Guilt is a feeling. Not a fact. You can feel guilty and still have made the right choice."

The words calmed the internal storm.

Didn't solve. But calmed.

"Thank you," Camila said when they hung up.

"Always. And Camila? Your children will be okay. Because they have you."

---

That night, Camila wrote in her diary:

*"Today my son cried because his father didn't show up.*

*And I felt guilty.*

*Because it was me who left.*

*But Dr. Lucas reminded me: I left something toxic.*

*Ricardo is the one who chooses not to show up.*

*They are different things.*

*Perfect mother doesn't exist.*

*But present mother, who loves, who tries - she exists.*

*And I am her.*

*Not perfect. But present.*

*And maybe that's enough."*

Closed diary with small peace.

Not happiness. But acceptance.

That making the right choice didn't mean it wouldn't hurt.

It meant doing it even if it hurt.

And that, slow and painful discovery, was real motherhood.

Imperfect. Honest. Present.

And it was enough.
