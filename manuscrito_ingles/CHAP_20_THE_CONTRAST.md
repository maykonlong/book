# CHAPTER 20
## The Contrast

Saturday morning. Camila went to pick up the kids at Ricardo's aparthotel.
Normally he left them at the reception. But today, Leo had forgotten his asthma inhaler upstairs. And Leo was coughing.

"Come up to get it, Camila. I'm finishing getting ready," said Ricardo over the intercom.

Camila went up. Heart racing. Entering his "home". Enemy territory.

The door was unlocked.
She entered.

The smell hit first. A mixture of stored damp clothes, yesterday's pizza, and cheap hotel disinfectant.
The living room was chaos. Pizza box on the sofa. Sneakers thrown in the middle of the way. Dirty glasses on the coffee table.

Ricardo appeared from the bedroom, buttoning his shirt. Wet hair.
"Leo is looking for the inhaler in the room," he said, embarrassed.

Camila looked around.
At home, Ricardo always complained about "mess". If there was a toy on the floor, it was a crisis.
There, he lived in a pigsty.

"You are living like this?" she asked, genuinely surprised.

"The cleaning lady comes on Monday," he evaded, defensive. "And I'm working a lot, don't have time for frills."

Camila looked at the kitchenette sink. Pile of dishes.
Looked at his shirt. Wrinkled on the back.

And had an epiphany.
Clear. Crystal clear.

Ricardo wasn't organized. Ricardo wasn't demanding.
Ricardo was *taken care of*.
By her.

For eleven years, she was the manager of his life. The one who ensured the shirt was ironed, that the house smelled of lavender, that the food was on the table.
She was the scaffolding that supported the facade of "organized successful man".

Without her, he was this. A 38-year-old man who didn't know how to wash a glass.

Camila felt a sudden urge to laugh.
Not of mockery. But of relief.

She had spent years thinking that *she* was the problem. That *she* wasn't good enough. That *she* was disorganized.
But his disorder proved otherwise.

Leo came out of the room with the inhaler.
"Found it, mom! It was under dad's bed. Along with a dirty sock."

Camila held back laughter.
"Let's go, son. Bye, Ricardo. Try to iron that shirt better next time. It's creased."

Left and closed the door.
Went down the elevator feeling three kilos lighter.

The myth of Perfect Ricardo had fallen.
And with it, the last bit of admiration that still bound her.
She hadn't lost an amazing partner. She had gotten rid of a lifelong rehabilitation project.

In the afternoon, at home, Camila decided to look through a box of old photos.
Needed to see. Confirm.

Found a photo from ten years ago. Newlyweds.
Camila was too thin. Tense smile. Eyes of someone who wants to please.
Ricardo was impeccable. Owner of the world smile. Hand on her shoulder, possessive.

Picked up a photo from now. From Leo's party (someone had taken it and sent it to the group).
Camila was disheveled, sweaty, no makeup.
But she was laughing. With Leo on her lap.
Did she look tired? Yes.
But she looked *alive*.

The Camila from the old photo was a porcelain doll. Perfect and fragile.
The Camila of now was made of flesh, bone, and scar.
And she was much, much more beautiful.

She put the box away.
Not with longing.
But like someone putting away a historical document of an extinct civilization.
That Camila didn't exist anymore.
And the new Camila wouldn't trade places with her for anything in this world.
