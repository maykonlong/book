# CHAPTER 09 – The Conversation with the Kids

## Chapter 09 – The Conversation with the Kids

The hardest part wasn’t confronting Ricardo.

It wasn’t listening to Dona Vera.

It wasn’t deciding.

The hardest part was looking at Léo and Bia and having to explain that their lives were about to change – that their family was about to change – by her choice.

Guilt was a monster that bit Camila’s chest every time she thought about it.

But she knew: it was now or it would be five, ten, twenty years from now. The longer she waited, the worse it would get for everyone – especially the kids.

---

Ricardo left the house that night.

After the confrontation with Dona Vera, after Camila locked herself in the bedroom, he knocked on the door and shouted a few more things ("you’ll regret this", "you’re being selfish", "you’re destroying this family"). Camila didn’t answer. Eventually he grew tired, grabbed the keys and slammed the door.

He went to his mother’s house, presumably.

Much better.

Camila waited to hear the car drive away. Then she left the bedroom.

Léo and Bia were in the living room watching cartoons, but not really watching – just staring at the TV with that empty expression of someone trying not to feel what they were feeling.

Camila sat on the sofa between them.

— "Did you have dinner?"

Léo shook his head.

— "I’m not hungry."

— "Me neither," Bia whispered.

Camila grabbed the remote and turned the TV off.

— "We need to talk."

Bia started whining immediately.

— "Are you leaving?"

Camila’s heart broke.

— "No, my love. I’m not leaving. I’ll never leave you. Not you, not Léo. Never."

— "But you fought with dad."

— "I fought. And Mom is so, so sad that you saw that. It shouldn’t have happened."

Léo, the older, more perceptive one, asked the question Camila knew would come:

— "Are you two separating?"

There was no way to lie to them.

— "Yes."

Bia sobbed. Léo turned pale.

Camila pulled both of them close. A tight hug.

— "Look at me. Both of you. Look."

They looked back with eyes full of tears, confusion, fear.

— "Dad and Mom won’t live together anymore. I know that scares you. I’m scared too. But you need to understand something very important: this isn’t your fault. Nothing you did caused this. Okay?"

— "Why?" Léo asked, voice trembling. — "Why can’t you stay together?"

How do you explain to an eight‑year‑old complex concepts like partnership, mental load, emotional toxicity?

Camila tried to simplify:

— "Sometimes two people get married and are happy. And sometimes, over time, they realize they’re no longer happy together. When that happens, it’s better for them to be apart so everyone can be happier."

— "But I don’t want you to be apart," Bia cried.

— "I know, my love. I know. If I could do it in a way that didn’t hurt you, I would. But sometimes we have to do hard things now so that everyone will be better later."

— "Will I have to choose?" Léo asked. — "Between you and dad?"

— "No. Never. You’ll have both of us. Always. Just in different houses."

— "How does that work?"

Camila breathed. She tried to explain what she herself still didn’t fully understand.

— "We’re still working out the details, but probably you’ll spend some days with me and some days with dad. And even on days you’re not with me, you can call me whenever you want. I’ll always be here for you."

— "What about holidays?" Bia asked, still crying. — "And Christmas?"

— "We’ll make it work. Families can look many different ways. And we’ll always be a family – just a different kind of family."

Léo stayed quiet, processing. Then he asked:

— "Are you sad?"

The question broke Camila.

Because should she lie? Say she was fine, that everything was under control? Or be honest?

She chose honesty.

— "I am. Very sad. But also a little relieved. I was exhausted, Léo. Very, very exhausted. I couldn’t be happy. And a child deserves parents who are happy, even if they’re not together."

Léo hugged his mother tightly – that child’s hug that understands more than it should.

— "I just want you not to be so sad, Mom. You’ve been sad for a long time."

He had noticed.

Children always notice.

Camila cried. She hugged both children. They stayed there, a little ball of sadness and attempted healing, on the living‑room sofa.

After a while, Bia asked:

— "Can we order pizza?"

Camila laughed through the tears.

— "Sure. Let’s order pizza."

— "With stuffed crust?"

— "With stuffed crust."

Small things. Small comforts.

They didn’t fix everything, but they helped.

---

Ricardo came home late.

Camila heard the key turn. She walked to the living room.

He stopped when he saw her.

— "The kids?"

— "Sleeping."

— "You told them?"

— "I told them. They deserved to hear it straight from us."

Ricardo ran a hand over his face. For the first time, he seemed genuinely moved.

— "Are they okay?"

— "What did you expect? That they’d celebrate?"

He sat on the sofa, looking smaller, more broken.

For a second – just a second – Camila almost felt pity. Almost went back.

But then she remembered.

She remembered every time she asked for help and got none. Every night she cried alone. Every time Léo, eight years old, had to wake his dad because Mom was ill.

She remembered it wasn’t just a fight. It was years of disconnection.

And the pain passed.

— "We need to decide how it will be," she said.

— "I don’t want this, Camila."

— "I know. But I want it. And it has to be enough."

He looked at her. He tried once more:

— "I can change. I’ll go to therapy. I’ll help more. I promise."

*I promise.*

How many times had she heard that?

— "Ricardo, you had eleven years to change. I asked, I begged. And you only promised when I said I was leaving. That’s not wanting to change. That’s trying to keep me."

— "It’s not that! I love you!"

— "I believe you love me, in your way. But not the way I need."

— "Then what do you need? Tell me! I’ll do it!"

But it was too late.

Camila shook her head.

— "It’s not about a checklist. It’s about you not needing a list. It’s about you wanting. And you only want now because I’m leaving. Not because you understood. But because you’re losing comfort."

Ricardo fell silent.

Because she was right. And he knew it.

— "Tomorrow," Camila said, tired, — "I’ll look for a lawyer. I’ll understand how it works. We’ll do this as peacefully as possible, for our kids. But it will happen."

— "I won’t make it easy."

Camila looked at him, a mix of sadness and disappointment.

— "I know."

She went to the bedroom and lay down.

And finally, after everything, she felt something she hadn’t felt in a long time:

Peace.

It wasn’t happiness. Not yet.

But it was peace.

The peace of someone who finally stopped swimming against the current.

Someone who finally allowed herself to let go.

Or to sink.

Or to float.

Whatever came, it would come.

But she would no longer fight alone for something that needed two.

Not anymore.

---

The next morning Camila woke early, made coffee, got the kids up, and went about the day as usual.

But something was different.

The weight on her chest felt lighter.

The mental checklist was still there, but it seemed… smaller. More manageable.

Because now there was an end in sight.

An end she chose.

Ricardo left early, avoiding. Running away, as always.

Camila took the kids to school.

Léo got out of the car slowly.

— "Mom?"

— "Yes, love?"

— "Are you going to be okay?"

The question was a knife to her heart. Eight years old, worried about her.

But Camila smiled, genuine, for the first time in a long time.

— "I will. I promise. And you will too. Everyone will."

He accepted, because he wanted to believe. And because he needed to.

Camila watched them walk into school, waved, waited until they disappeared from view.

Then she picked up her phone.

Searched: *"divorce lawyer São Paulo"*.

Opened the first page.

Called.

— "Hello, good morning. I’d like to schedule a consultation."

And that’s how it began.

The end of the marriage.

And the beginning of something else.

The beginning of Camila.
