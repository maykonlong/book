# CHAPTER 11
## The Process

If the emotional pain of divorce is a tsunami, the bureaucratic pain is quicksand. Slow, sticky, suffocating.

Camila discovered this the following Monday, at Dr. Patricia Alves' office.

The office was in an old commercial building downtown. Gray carpet, smell of coffee brewed a long time ago, and piles of files bound in brown covers that looked like tombstones of dead marriages.

Dr. Patricia was direct. A woman in her fifties with red-rimmed glasses and no patience for beating around the bush.

"Assets?" she asked, pen poised over a yellow pad.

"A paid-off apartment. A 2018 car in my name. A 2020 car in his name. Complete furniture."

"Investments? Savings? Stocks?"

Camila hesitated.
"I don't think so. Ricardo always said we lived 'on the edge'. That there was nothing left to invest."

Dr. Patricia raised a painted eyebrow.
"'Think'? Did you not have access to his accounts?"

"No. We split the household bills, but each took care of their own salary."

"Classic mistake number one," murmured the lawyer, writing something down. "We'll ask for a breach of bank secrecy if we go to litigation. But first, let's try for an agreement. How much does he earn?"

"I think about twelve thousand net. He's a project manager."

"And you?"

"Six thousand. I'm a senior analyst."

"Great. He earns double. We'll ask for child support of 30% of his net income for the two children, plus health insurance and school."

"He won't accept," said Camila, feeling her stomach turn. "He already said he won't give me 'a single cent'."

"Men say a lot of things in the heat of anger, dear. But the law says otherwise. The law doesn't care about his wounded ego. The law cares about the fact that children eat, dress, and study."

Dr. Patricia turned the page.

"Now, the ugly part. The apartment. If he doesn't want to leave..."

"He already left. He's at a hotel."

"Great. That constitutes abandonment of the home if he stays away too long, but in the case of an agreement, it makes it easier. Do you want to stay in the apartment?"

"I do. It's close to the kids' school. It's their home."

"Then you'll have to buy his share. Or sell and split. Do you have money to buy 50% of a property right now?"

Camila froze.
"No. I don't even have ten thousand saved."

"Then we have a problem. If he demands his share in cash, you will have to sell."

Sell the house.
Take Leo and Bia out of the only home they knew. Another rupture.

Camila felt the weight of money—or the lack of it—crushing her shoulders.

"What if... what if I give up alimony for myself? And keep the house as compensation?" suggested Camila.

"Alimony for an ex-spouse is rare nowadays, Camila. You work, you are young. The judge would hardly grant it. What we are talking about is child support. And that you *cannot* give up. It's their right, not yours."

Camila left the office with a list of documents to provide that looked like an encyclopedia.

Updated marriage certificate.
Children's birth certificates.
Property deed.
Pay stubs.
Bank statements.
Income Tax Declaration.

She got into the car. The March heat turned the vehicle into an oven.

Picked up her phone to check the account balance.
R$ 420.00.
It was the 12th of the month.

How was she going to pay a lawyer?
How was she going to pay condo fees alone?
How was she going to pay for school if Ricardo delayed the child support?

The fear of post-divorce poverty is a cold ghost that haunts every woman who dares to leave a financially comfortable marriage.
*Will I make it?*
*Will I have to take the kids out of private school?*
*Will I have to move back in with my mother?*

The "empowered woman" who left home determined in the previous chapter was now there, sweating in a hot car, counting mental coins and feeling like a fraud.

But then she remembered the scene of the spilled milk.
Remembered Leo trying to wake his father.

*Money we chase after,* she thought, starting the car. *Dignity, once lost, cannot be bought back.*

She would find a way.
She would sell pot cakes. Would drive Uber on weekends. Would ask for a raise.
But she wouldn't go back.

She drove off. The engine noise choked a little, but it went.
Just like her.
Choking, but going.
